400,Dead Kennedys,"[Verse 1]
Happy hour belongs to America's best-loved thugs
Here come the four-wheel drive prosthetic penises
Got your gun racks, tractor tires and lynch mob drivers, we couldn't find a chick to sit in the middle
So we drink ourselves sick, lean out the windows and pinch ass instead

[Chorus]
We are the goons of Hazzard
Glorified on your TV
We run down bikes and hitchhikers
'Cause we know we'll get off scot-free

[Verse 2]
We're the vigilante heroes of your tough guy flicks
Bashing punks and bums and fags with our baseball bats
No deer to blow away in the woods today so we go to Oroville and shoot a black kid down
Or waste demonstrators in Greensboro instead

[Chorus]
We are the goons of Hazzard
Glorified on your TV
We'll leave you in a pool of blood
'Cause we know we'll get off scot-free

Get him!
Get him!
C'mere!
C'mere!
Say something to me?
We've got him cornered
We've got him cornered
Is anybody looking?
Does anybody even care? No!
Yes!

[Verse 3]
The local papers paint us up to be big heroes
City fathers and chamber of commerce want us deputized
Stoner gestapo keeping your town clean, get a shave kid, we'll pay you as a strikebreaker
Maybe you'll be make Tac Squad for the L.A.P.D

At a man who’s not like you?
Go clean the kitchen, you little rat

I coax thе man inside my home
I offer him a tasty drink
And bеfore he even has time to think
He takes my hand, and we’re in love

We’re married within a year
Like magic, I’ve gotten the boy
And what’s a potion when I only see beauty?
And who cares if our love isn’t pure?
I’ve finally got the one that I want
And we’ll be happy for sure, for sure

For I cannot solve the mystery
Of the Riddle lying next to me
Too bad he doesn’t really love me
No, he’s just under a spell
I can’t live with the guilt, so I’ll just let him go
And myself as well

I stumble to a battered door
I scream, collapse; I’m on the floor
I cannot breathe, but I’m a mum
I touch my child and name him Tom

And what is death when new life is created?

Pride comes before a fall, my friend, but how much will remain

Always something going on in her mind
Hard to explain, but so easy to find
And through the mist of time it brings her the past again

Lovers, friends and better moments remain
Only in her head, but don't kill the pain
Until there's nothing else to do, but to cry out loud
Waiting for tomorrow, waiting for someone
Laying awake through the night, until the morning comes
Wonder if that feeling will ever go away
Pride comes before a fall, my friend, but how much will remain

Now she stays there, looking for a sign
And for what it's worth, she's got nothing to hide
Chasing answers, but they never really show
Does she know herself, does she know time at all?

Introductions don't happen when you walk in the room
Cause by then people all have first impressions on you
From what they've heard
From what their friends have said
They're all opinionated
Thoughts locked in their head
You move in and they're all already on to you
Your awkward smile reassures the boys you've seen them move
Their huddle forms
Their game plans set
The pack become competitors and you're the one they're out to get

[Verse 2]

One by one you write them off cause you have found their floors
That ones a smack-head and the other's scared of the dance floor
Theres that one who sits waiting for his chance
When you've had a couple glasses (Just wait till the hour passes)
Intoxicated your thought process it gets messed up
Next boy's in play seems like he will be the lucky one
Effortlessly he moves over and takes your hand
Finds you a place to talk
Somewhere you can still hear the band
[Bridge]

He says
(What's your name then?)
That you know
(Heard you'll do this)
Well I won't
Is that what you think of me?

The three nominees for the presidential candidate
Were Martin Van Buren, a former president and an abolitionist
James Buchanan, a moderate
Lewis Cass, a general and expansionist
From Nashville came a dark horse riding up
He was James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump

Austere, severe, he held few people dear
His oratory filled his foes with fear
The factions soon agreed
He's just the man we need
To bring about victory
Fulfill our manifest destiny
And annex the land the Mexicans command
And when the votes were cast the winner was
Mister James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump

In four short years he met his every goal
He seized the whole southwest from Mexico
Made sure the tariffs fell
And made the English sell the Oregon territory
He built an independent treasury
Having done all this he sought no second term
But precious few have mourned the passing of

On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""

No nothing can hold me back from what my destiny holds

Say, come again
Are you ready to reap what you've sewn
Say, come again
Have your losses equated to growth

Bones, bleak and fiend
We keep running on empty
I can feel the heat
Brushing up my knees
And I know that this isn’t worth saving
You’re messing with my head
Likely we’ll end up dead
Can’t trust a word you said
We cannot make amends
You’re messing with my head
Likely we’ll end up dead
Casted aside
This body’s a prison my spirit is trapped inside
I won't let this best be so don't fucking test me
You won't make it out alive
Attempt to leave here with closure
You wanted was smoke from the jump too
Wanna see my chest filled with slugs too
And you still act like its love too
How could you be such a fake fuck
Feel like its been time to raise up
Can't snooze on this movement bitch wake up


Say, come again
Don't know what the fuck that you thought this was
Say, come again
Take your precious memories and burn em up
Say, come again

Say, come again
Cause you always took it in blood

I could find this was all just a lie
Bite my tongue, leave this feeling behind
This was all just lethargic to you
Why fight now
That’s why we could never open up
Messing with my head probably end up dead
Forget the lies you said until the very end
Find our place let’s lay this to rest
Forget the silence let’s leave with closure
