When everything is golden
Nobody will feel golden
Living like they gods
So we call em fucking odin
Boats were never rowing
Beats were always flowing
Homies found a place to be going
To find their passion
To follow their dreams
But you cannot dream, when your awake
Everybody just woke up
Models gonna throw up
Homie when you gonna grow up
I froze up
When I realized
That I've getting older
Used to be 7 years old
Now a 15 year old man
I only got one plan
Only got this one life
So I
Felt something was missing
So we started searching
The whole world started turning
My vision started blurring
By the time I came back
Everything was diffrent
Everything has changed man
So much shit was missing
So I went up on a mission
To re-fix the system
That we all call living
That clock just keeps on ticking

Ramen that I used to eat on Tuesdays, fuck what you make
Climbing up the ladder, this is Doomsday, where the crew stay
Signs of pitty patter from the crusade, thats a touché
Lines of ""whats the matter"" from my roommate, nothing to say
As I wake up from my dream, this shit ain't what it seems
A song to take up on thе screen, then you should've just seen
The look that brought up on thе scene, man it wasn't so keen
It shook him up, the certain thing that it wasn't so clean
He was writing lyrics just to make the people hear it
Despite the fearing, it was too fake, didn't put sincere in
And thats the clearance, he's not the one that was made for steering
I fight the spirit, plus I steer it, man I mean this dearest

[Verse 2: XLoRacer]
Pause for a second as I get another weapon to kill these adolescents
And thats just with my deadly presence
I take a gamble on life with a pair of dice for paradise
And since its not making cents, its really hard to pay the price
And then I figured out that there's no second chances
I skipped out on heaven to chill where the devil dances
To only see that that demons that were haunting me was self inflicted pain that was given' to me mentally
So I, started to smoke it away
Thought it was a clear escape and kept telling myself that ""it's okay""
But as these blunts keep getting rolled up
I keep getting shortness of breath and my words get choked up
I might as well not put myself through this abysmal hell
The only thing I want in life is to prevail
To tell my grandchildren all of my greatest tails
About this young hero who achieved his own holy grail

With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity

Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street

Change to better yourself and do better things

That every adult sins and it was just my turn
Ima firm believer in hit your head to keep it up
Cause you was looking down instead of looking up
Hard to see where you going with your eyes closed
You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

If only I could fly, but no not I

I got money but can't afford happiness what could I buy
Maybe a slice of pie or a piece of mind
Who am I, if I can't touch the Sky, a penguin
I taught I saw a putty cat inside brave men
Hoped ya peeped the quotes, they free but in the same boat
They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

You want beef, the top of your physique will hit the concrete
I rap like Iraq and bomb like Saddam
Rock a spot on your block that your clique's clocking on
A lot of little brains and names are flaming out the middle
So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole

Some meditate, some call it prayer
Some medicate, some pray for saviors
Some put in work, some call in favors
Don't call it luck, it's the fruit of my labor

No hand outs, no hand outs, unless they have something to gain
No I'm not sharing my earnings, unless you've been sharing my pain
I don't know how to ask for help, always thought that shit was vane

Surfing Instagram on my Apple phone - no way!
I think in this way I’m visualizing something

Pretending being rich and wealthy, blowing flour but still healthy, always draped in something classy, behind the wheel of Maserati, hanging heavy Louie bags hella full with money bands, living in a penthouse which is higher than the clouds

As an employee I’ve earned some funny money
Yeah
Never invested it, but felt like Axelrod Bobby
Spent a half on my Stans which are white and green
A couple of kickz is worth of fucking routine
My Instagram is opened on pages of business bloggers
Bentleys at the background , they all draped in suits and loafers
Double tap on their pictures the only thing that I do
Instead of building my life I flush the time down the tube
Yeah, ugh

I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine

This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword

Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah

Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze

I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders

We got the area secured now, triple the c-4
And get of the whole floor, you copy?
I copy that, we got the whole music business wired
So when this shit blow, ya whole empire's expired

Traditional medicinal sentences, fresh quotes
And facts brought to back block against the trash talk

Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears
You gonna switch your gears and push till shit's clear yes sir

Guess I killed who I used to be
I'm a mess, I'm fucked up
Yeah, the slut wasted all my love
Got straight A's, all I was
But who am I once highschools up?

We were told how we should be; now we live in disbelieve
Of the people that we meet, so we stick to memories
And your parents aren't in love; we have holes inside our hearts
Things will end up in th past; the pain ain't meant to last

Moved out west; still searching for something
Took a year for me to stop running
And all my friends, they love who I found and
Will stick with me until the end

[majora]
Fuck all your highschool parties; we in the skudio living the dream
And we don't turn back for sorries; they used to look at me weird in the streets
Thinking 'bout all of these lonely nights, I'm glad that it's over now
Fuck it, it's over now
I've been so low, you can't hold me down

Fuck all your highschool parties; I don't even wanna know nobody
You look at me all worried; look at yourself and tell me you ain't boring

Yeah, I know I look different
You're trying hard to fit into your system
Inside your mind, you got all of it twisted
That is the reason I won't be the victim

Why are you so close minded?
You got all these opportunities but choose to be blinded
Brank Boyz pull up to your party, we ain't even invited
Just to show you what's up; yeah, we don't give a fuck, yeah, yeah

[majora]
Things change, but I won't forget
Ain't nobody used to check up on me when my thoughts collapsed and
Now I try my best to rid old habits; need to redefine the shit I called friendship
Yeah, all my friends are going through it sometimes, but at least we're all inside this shit together
Fuck all your highschool parties; we in the skudio living the dream
And we don't turn back for sorries; they used to look at me weird in the streets

What's a day from sycamore avenue?
Was babbling mumbling verbs I gotta prove

Was roaming these neighborhood’s funny we know
The outcome of crime guess God gave us a conscious too
So The only way to fly out the block was to be Lebron and
Pray to God that one day these new casters would come
They Casper see they didn’t show up we traded Spaulding for guns
And trapping keys like we stacking bricks on my mommas lawns
My Homie in the cell doing time like Rolex watch, The only things
That matters to him to watch the clocks, reminiscing on patience
Them day you didn’t know hatred, phone chirping from girls so when
You had they digits you made it, Pillow talks from this lil momma
She said was-sup? The Lust burning like the flames of the Hebrew
Boys in the furnace

Yeah
[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I hear them in the crowd, shouting out ""let them speak""
Before the bullets fly, I'm arriving at my peace
And it's there for a second. Gone in a blink
So I don't need a ride I'll drive myself to the brink
Dearly departed. Dearly departed
I hope you're happy now
Look what you started

I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar
Stuck with ugly faces, scarred
Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands
[Chorus]
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
I won't come round here again until the flask's dry

[Verse 2]
It’s time to take the stand, raise your hand
Try to beat the case again
Why'd you shake the branch deeply rooted in forsaken land
It's not your place to operate on patience you keep locked away
Not today, yesterday, tomorrow
What you got to say?
No excuse, searching for words that never come
Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time

Taking no one's input but your own
Your confidence high, but you’re making mine low
I'm talking, but you ain't listening (Hello?)
Never saw you with a smile
Won’t be back home in a while or ever
You know you coulda been better
But so could have I
You don't see me depressed with these dismal eyes
Why?
I just don't think it's a matter of time
Am I getting a call to come and die? (Come and die)
I'm broken
I think I might (might, might commit suicide)
I'm broken, can you fix me?
Listening to this again might be the end of me
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
Singing this again might be the enemy
Singing this again might be the enemy
What if I am the enemy?

I just pray they take the shackles off
Need my people from behind the wall
I don't even wanna answer call

This some heartfelt shit, catch a hot slug
We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly
I can't go back to the snow
No boots on my feet, wit' my sneaks full of holes
Mama did her best, but she did it on her own
When I had nothing left, still got it like I'm grown

I don't wanna see you back my dawg
I need my people from behind the walls
I don't even wanna answer calls

You got something to lose don't let 'em take it
Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces
Couple niggas doing life, growing ancient
I just wanna better the gang, let's get a spaceship
Roney still clean the block up, call me maintenance
Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican
Get my youngin drop a package off
Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved
'Cause my dawg behind the wall playing basketball
Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot
Roney like the sun, he can heat the block
We don't need to stop
We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot
Need my dawg from behind the wall
He locked up playing basketball

Hoping out the passenger like Trey, there he go

Living vicious all night

Jump me, in it for life
Throw me on that corner, get me stabbed, it's alright
Feel like nobody love me, and my heart get cold at night
For the devil creeping on me, I ain't looking for the light
I ain't shit to these kids
I ain't shit to this bitch
They just look at me like dollars, give a fuck if I'm dead
It's just on to the next one, and fuck what he said
Even if I give a arm and leg
This my soul and spirit coming out, hold up really

Nobody likes to mention
White progressive philantrophic extortion of our condition
We ignore it 'til we wanted an apartment for us to live in
And is rented by a liberal proponent of capitalism
Who believes that the God's gift to Black and Brown people
Then appropriate the culture, of which they are a vulture
Caught the rollers on the lady with her baby in the stroller
Who was raised where they just moved to from in the zone
It's the old neighborhood with the whiter population
Under the codenames, ""Up and coming, revitalization""

Hi Mrs. Lynch, this is Mrs. Zubrod. I'm calling from Deerfield Elementary about your son, Jason. Um, I've been having a few concerns just about his ability to focus in class. There are some options that I've briefly discussed. Um, we see this a lot with children and it might be some form of ADD. I'm not a doctor so I would suggest that maybe-
Uh, Mrs. Lynch, this is Mr. Bailey, Jason's fifth-grade teacher. I'm calling 'cause I'm very concerned about your son. It seems very possible that he will not pass the fifth grade. He's been failing very regularly-
Mrs. Lynch, this is Principal Reynolds, calling again for the third time. Please give us a call back as soon as you can. Jason has been suspended from school yet again for getting into a fight. Um, he's becoming a real problem for the kids. It seems he's getting into an altercation every other day. Um, we've tried to reach out, we're trying to help him. But there's only so much I can do. Mrs. Lynch, we have no choice but to suspend your son immediately-
This is Detective Pearson with the Third District Police Department. We are searching for Jason Mills; he's been implicated in a armed robbery case. We have a good bit of evidence that Jason is involved. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible. It's nothing to worry about, hope I hear from you soon-

Who the trillest?
Who the shooter? Who got shot? Who survived?
Who diminished? Who the witness? Who detective?
Who the medic? Who the dead? Who arrested?
You the dead, you the lesson
We survived, we ain't stressin'
I was tryna live it, I was tryna be it
I lived with my mother and stepfather, both had degrees, was heated
Went the college route
But I doubt that I'm going to college now
I was tryna be flyer than Batman so I got me the strap, man
And I started stealing and turned into Robin now
I'm just a middle-class nigga who's class was a mixture
Of them spellin' bee winners and them PG killers
Flop, flop, flop, flop, hit your ass with bananas, they gorillas
Knock, knock, knock, knock at my door, asking me to come and kick it
I was different, see, my family distanced me but I was curious
The mystery of chilling down the street, knowing I shouldn't be
Was lit to me and that's the reason why that I am literally
The only one to go to jail in my family's history

[Chorus: IDK]
A ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga
Steal the strap from my neighbor's safe, brrat-brrat nigga
They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers
At the end of the day, I'm a young black nigga
I'm a ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga

Hear the church bell ringing
Murder every rapper better start repenting
Heard of every rap you fuckers spitting
Take your herd to the lab and start re penning
Now they singing the same
With limited brains
Tryna mimic for fame
They killing the game
They will never be tame
Taking the reigns
And im making a name
You the best rapper in the school?
Call yourself a leader I will show you how to rule
On this beat defeat ya and your punishment is cruel
Ask me for a feature im a freeze ya you a fool
Think I might not kill ya you like Freiza im Goku
Wasn't gonna feed ya but this shit is getting deeper im  competing to be-seat the rappers I lampoon
Callin me a freak
You wallow in defeat
Control alt delete, you reboot I resume
Cuz Your Autotune
Is so out of tune
So now I presume
That you’re a buffoon
Take trash like raccoons
Airheads, like balloons
My bad that was criminal
You know who you are
So this is not subliminal
Pull up in a car
Your condition is now critical
Ripping up your art
What's left of it is spiritual
{Verse 2}
To tell you the truth
Its a crime scene when I get in the booth
Look at rhyme schemes its getting coo coo
Its so obscene merci beaucoup
Know what that means? That means thank you
If you don't believe search on Google
Im like chlorine I clean the pool
The one with genes that none of you knew
But im coming in through
Coming in fru-ition
With the ammunition
And on a mission
To show im different
To all these bitches
They load the clips in
And Damn they missed it
Im on some slick shit
A bomb im spitting
I take the pin and
Take the pen
And I throw the nades
Into virgin kids that
Gone ballistic
Cuz they are so lit
{Verse 3}
In quotes you see
Everything I say
Is tongue in cheek
Rappers gonna spray at my physique
Changing up the waves
Im like mystique
All they gonna say
My lines antique
Just so they remain
Right at their peak
Ima go and frame
This as perfect
Cuz I Spitfire
You’re Mozambique
Cuz I'm an old head
Fire off a diss
And now they bolted
Snakes are gna hiss
They so revolting
They soul is open
And ima close it
No room for moping
Im cold I'm frozen
Home alone ima trump
Macaulay Culkin
Writing and they stumped
On Green Im Hulking
Wannabes i corrupt
Ive barely spoken
Scary and they jump
Cuz I've awoken
From their provoking
Shaken and choking
Give rhymes in bulking
This scheme just won't end
And now they hoping
That theres a cure
For this pathogen
Disease so pure
Have to cope and
They're unsure
Doctors they phoning

I'm not having any of this shit
I will handle petty disrespect
I will dismantle everything  you say
And will show you i am here to stay

One punch now run it back six zero
Touchdown bitch go and run it back
Come against me itll be fourth down you runts go punt to the field and track
Cuz your field in tracks appears to be whack
Need a peer to smack you back on track
When your backs on track
Ima prevail and derail a bitch like its Amtrak
Cuz in all degrees im meant to be mentally
The best emcee on mp3s so i just speed to hit 90
Thats the right angle on all fours form a rectangle
Find it a cute to think you obtuse
Got a screw loose cuz you're in my shadow

And the feds just dropped my case for identity theft
Too busy gettin' money, I ain't tryna have sex
Too busy gettin' money, I ain't gotta get a job
Do the dash on the cops, turn my shit on sports mode (Skrrt)
Got a text from the plug sayin', ""Send a big load""
Up need a few pots, he whippin' on a big stove (Stove)
Gotta stash all the shit when a nigga hit the road (Road)
Cause the shit gon' get sold
Couple bitch niggas told
Couple bitch niggas snitched
I'm just tryna get rich
Why your ho around me? Nigga, grab your bitch
Think they tryna set the plan, I'm 'bout to grab my stick (Damn)
[Chorus]
Brought my reader and my writer on the road with me
Yesterday I bought a brand new strap and it hold fifty
Nigga try to take something, I'ma give his ass the whole 50
A nigga's bitch just called my phone like, ""Baby, can I hold fifty?"" (Hello?)
Run this shit up on my own, you niggas wasn't on the road with me
Street nigga made a half a million off a laptop (Laptop)
Beat my uncle ass 'cause I caught him smokin' crack rocks (Damn)
Gave your bitch backshots
Niggas better soon as they hear the strap pop
Put a new beam on my chop like it's Black Ops (Bow)
Swipin' these cards everyday, a nigga can't stop
Wait 'til this tape drop
Pourin' up straight drop
Got a Gucci headband on like AI
I just popped ten Percs and I ain't high (Damn)

[Verse 2]
Got a couple hologram scannable IDs
Get a VPN just to switch my IP
And I get half off with IKEA
I'm so blowed, boy, I can't see ya
And I feel just like John Cena
Your bitch asked could she hit my reefer
Got to Kony, get a pita
Fake ID, my name is Peter
Your bitch a fuckin' leecher

The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin' backwards
Nothin' y'all said made an ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out, got reversible rhymes
We could go pop with it or run the block with it
Never before done 'til The Firm did it

​But my success was written before my birth
​I excel from the energy I exert
​The world cracked open when I dropped the merch
​Zombies crawlin' out of the ground clawin' the earth

​Went out to Rome, spent a weekend in Greece
​Poured liquor in a glass and rolled weed in a leaf
​Momma cried out to Jesus, ""Lord keep him in peace!""
​They stay marginalizing Yeezus and they sleepin' on me

​I keep it raw with a sexy persona
​I play my role like a professional roller
​To move around, I do golds on the front and root canals on all the rest of my molars, Petie

​I told my Momma that I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best

​They comin' for my head, they comin' for my head

​Layin' the younger hoes and I'm lyin' about my age

​and the power of my penmanship can't be debated
​plus money's comin' in nowadays
​I'm elated, the car note was due yesterday and I can pay it

​It's the simple things that make me happy
​the girls that call me papi, my babies that call me daddy
​the fans that listen and help me like a taxi

​everybody rap but not everybody is savvy

Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia

Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)

Leather seats all wet, paint up on the Fleetwood
On this point, Jordans on my toes, did my feet good
Still got my Coogi, my shorty got a Gucci on
Flossing on the same track I hear Big and Gucci on
Now we remixed it like it's two different packs
Of Kool-Aid in the same jug, and I'm feeling same, thug
This is for the boys in blue, and the G's flamed up
I'm in the big body slab, raised up, game up!
[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more cause I got too much money in it

[Project Pat over Hook]
It's your boy....
Project Pattah

[Verse Two: Project Pat]
I still get if off with the soft and the hard
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Used to dodge them laws in them stolen cars
Now I'm Escalade, sitting high with the stars
Took a shine like a star, now my head is in the clouds
And I'm papered, so I'm right back on the line
Project Pat, my dog, and I'm leading half a pound
Cousin house in the bay, on the North side of town
Man, the streets in me, so I can't say I don't miss em
Dipping through the hood plucking chicks, but I don't kiss em
She wishin that I would take her home; long stick her
Then I get her back, hit it from the back and I'm gone
[Hook]

[Verse Three: Big Boi]
Can't be tripping bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can a nigga stop that?
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside
They try But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
But with success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, It's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow

Eating out the box like I got a Happy Meal
I crack the whip, then your bra and panties come up missing
Asking what’s my name like Rumpelstiltskin
There ain’t no competition and you can come petition
Ain’t nobody signing that, can’t get your vagina back
That pussy mine, that’s what you told me
Then like a pinwheel, you blowed me
You said it’s been the same shit since high school
You need a lil’ more like the girl that sing with Ja Rule
Well if you need space, that’s what I’ll provide you
Michael Phelps can’t swim in a child’s pool
Besides boo, I’ma see you again

You may have heard a lot about Rap Genius lately
But I suppose you have been looking at it rather sedately
Just another boring lyric site, nah, don't be fooled
Rap Genius ain't just a site where you get lyric-schooled
It's a collaborative annotation platform where you can explain anything
From lyrics to the Bible, we annotate everything
From TV shows to sports to the latest in games
To GRANDMA'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...
Nah, we ain't ashamed!
So how do they get, so many annotations without paying people?
It's quite clever actually
And if you write fluently, concise, and factually
You'll eventually find yourself part of the editors faculty
Where you can be free of the white hat normality

[Verse 2: Ryan Vice]
Ayo, we branched out to all different divisions
It's not just rap, we got poetry, rock and news
Plus a whole bunch of other crap
And being a great editor, with all you contribute
Can eventually earn you the moderator attribute
And then you will be able to reign over others
Gain some power, recognise talent where it is due
Oh what... I forgot about IQ!
IQ can be a motivator for many
Writing good annotations can get you plenty
But IQ whoring?
That's a definite penalty
[Verse 3: Ryan Vice]
Ugh, one more and I'm signing out

But all this great stuff aside, you wanna know the real reason
I stay allied, to the RG fam, representin' worldwide
It's the staff yo! Their friendly in nature
Mahbod, Shawn, Tom, Jeremy, Illan, Tobias, they always stay ill 'n
They got the mastermind persona
To keep the site running
And the Tech guys are great, making sure we stay update
To the annotation platform, that has improved my love for writing
Austin, Gavin, Tomi, you guys always stay trill
And Verified Artists? Most genius thing ever
This is a great leap for man, one of raps hugest endeavors
Which works quite a charm
Getting primary perspectives
On a line that may create an interpretation dilemma
Being able to connect with rappers themselves
Establishing a deeper connection between fans and artists is great for the health!

This I can't believe

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion [?]
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment
[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

Tell me the Princess is in another Castle
I'm gonna leave 'em to be snack food for Bowser

And this girl that I love won't be a prisoner

She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""

We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting

Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo

You see, I'm not your average nigga

I feel like I'm gone family I need that
But I still need to learn to grow on my own become a better man
When I be back
Get stronger mentally, physically, hold my ability get in my zone never show hostility keep to myself keep on showing positivity

I care too much about others and not on myself
Little did I know I was slowly breaking myself
This shit wasn't good at all for my health
Stuck in the chapter that seem to never end
Wish I could travel to Netherland
Not worry about anything in another land I recommend

But life isn't a fairy tale life ain't fair as you can tell
It doesn't want to see you succeed it just wants to see you fail
But fuck that shit I rebel wanna work my way up from nothing to something and never stop until I get to the top and be able to have my own story to tell

Not going to fall in line
Fall in what everyone does
Want to have a free mind
And do what I does create my own story without any worry I made my own choice I did it so that I can grow but my girl said that is some Bullshit well I think that you should just probably go
Not everything revolves around you
Gotta do shit for myself
I really did love you but I guess now I gotta focus more on me myself

I'm on a mission I'm a young man with a lot of ambition
I miss my family I truly do miss them but when I get back they really Be able to see my transition from a little boy to a young man
Understand I was too afraid to raise my hand but here I am a young Man with a plan and this is my place this is where I stand

Things change
Friends change
If you really think things can stay the same then you're probably insane
Go to learn how to adjust to the shit
Flip the page start on a new script
Forget about the past live in the now there's no better feeling than being on the mound

Living in the moment doing what I know what to do focus on my girl feeling like the one never two I hope you understand that too

Life going fast like a fastball throwing junk like a curve ball never could fall always gotta stand tall give it my all not like a nub never make a bad call

I'm not selfish I just wanna make my choice
Sending a message so I'm using my voice
All smiles and no tears it was just all a bit
Think you know me but you don't know me at all one bit

It takes a man to find his inner-peace so he can finally grease thy blunt

What if we all live in a curse?

Is there a way when we got to find a way to make pay?
Would work still be waiting for you when you awake?
To come back to the home that is laid to find that the floors had been paved
No matter what is placed on the plate
One thing that we will never do is Fade
Could it be right because we all make mistakes?
It is difficult to keep it real with the fake
Maybe laws should be tried again at a later date
With plenty of space to move away but have to stay
Where one can be in the same place but in a different State

Not a hand to aide in the crack between the quake
False representing evil ways by appearing saved
Out of all of the money made there is a breach in the safe

Gettin funky with the linguistics that's tradition
Infliction of pain on perpetrators, wishin
To slip in my position but nah, good riddance
If you didn't chip in you can't get a bit of this
Deliberate backstabbing that's shit's ridiculous

Funk fatality battle me? You catchin a blizzard
I got allergies affected by you wack ass niggas
Let me go and get bread spit hot lead, spread the gospel
Topple you fools that wanna pop so much shit
Fuck it time for me to flush it
Do the people justice rock my production
Hoes be lustin no you can't touch him
Follow his instructions, no he ain't fuckin'
Indestructible walk into the session
Soon as I catch the groove it's impressive
Dilapidated ya crew
Niggas fake as you?
I can't relate to you
This is for the real people who take the truth and ingest it
Let it radiate in the soul and manifest it

Verse One

I stopped writing rhymes on paper a long time ago
Cos that cannot be copy and pasted into the liner notes
And now I hardly use my MPC
Because I find it too restrictive when I’m making these beats
But yo’ I still use a valve mic
Because my vocals record clear
And people tell me that is what it sounds like
I got a PC and a Mac
So I can choose between Cubase and Logic when I build a track
The way I work is more flexible and the library of sounds available
And accessible’s tremendous, I still release music independent
The running time of my catalogue is endless
I’m more meticulous listening to audio
To make better music for the people who support me yo’
So for the fans who reach out with the messages
The Africans, Asians, English and Americans
My people in Europe, Australia, Canadians
I hope the music I make will bring some radiance into your life
Could be the words that I’m saying
Or the beats that are playing that can keep you maintaining
Hah’, so let me end this on a dope note
Something you can tell to all your people’s as a dope quote
You may have heard it before, but yo’ it’s mad sick

Yo what up with all these buster lame deer
Who just can’t hang or bang
Let alone be a brother from another mother playing it cool with poise like
True R&P emcee trailblazers that’s down by law to honorable
Hip hop
Causes prepared for whatever life throws at him
Generating interest
Not being boring likе some lame-o’s cause I’m spitting rhymеs for the unlucky kids
Without a dad or mom that got cheated in life blessing them reciting this psalm prayer
Hopefully to be answered as providence eventually so sucker lame deer playing adulting games
See the error in there ways that could never afford
To help
One another or be honest let alone fathom to understand why is that imagining
What it’s like to be younger again getting shafted caught in a dead end job
Life happens being stuck in the rat races maze thats why sinderella manns
Staying truest in this krush groove funkyfresh
Never stale
Just new photosynthesized oxygen every little step

Verse 2:
Whose living the coolest baller tipping for life thats got it made in the shade
Is what matters most fuck your opinion outside that conclusion
Without
Bullshit popularity contests dammit from east coast to west coast
Keep the crossover
Sinderella manns gonna stay frosty like a snowman using this funk while
Many act as if they enjoy being conventionally boring in some square trendy
Predictable life cycling manner sinderella mann
Won’t ever understand
Others lame deer games who shall remain nameless
Because your soo vain
You couldn’t keep the mic hot and you probably think this song is about you dont you dont you
Lacking Rockwell’s voice and rick James’s guitar skills
Cause you never had
The option or choice sinderella mann does barking preternatural powers in the dark
Rocking rhymes ripping the mic all indolent imbeciles can't relate to
With disgust in your eyes
Being another brick in the wall pussyfooter that doesn’t have shit on true loc’ed out

Your fucking brains out with funky grammar as a certified jammer living to win
Down to expose any flaker for the fraud you are through

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many

Should've listened Plato, should've listened to Aristotle
Wipe the frown of my face and then take it slow
Cigarettes for the show, it's time to read what I sow
Maybe stick around, we can swim down the rainbow heading east bound
Two tabs and a lock on the door
Is all we need to see what our first day got in store

[Verse2: Pablo]
I wonder why you plead guilty, You know you stole my heart, when i ask about the ventricle you say you got my blood
Im like wow!! ,what a criminal ,no police involved i just wanna fall inlove
I know you feeling the feeling that i've been trying to feel then you suddenly call the cops cause i had the same feeling
When i look at your eyes been trying to coup all my lies
Go bohloko nyana cause i had to act little nice
But 'whoa' mommie ema i think it's time for magadi, turn a lil angel like you, ke go etse legwabe
Matter of Fact, the ring is on your finger ring the bell let them fight, we need a pastor real quick so i can kiss the bride
And your ex is jealous babe let me solve for x, you have a studio heart that's why i hear your beat
Babe it's not easy saying goodbye
But the truth true love will never ever die

Just for reference, and I may re-post this as I see fit, here is my rough criteria for judging. Obviously, since this is text based, it’s much easier to disregard rhetorical flourishes, so don’t expect to get points for claims you don’t back up. Anyways:Demonstrates an intricate understanding of how (not necessarily to what extent..) their album impacted Hip Hop culture.Differentiates between cultural implications of Hip Hop as a sociopolitical platform, and Rap (i.e. rhyming words over a beat to create multi-rhythmic patterns) as an art form.Clearly states their main points of argument, and continually refers back to them in order to clarify their reasoning.Supports their main points with some sort of verifiable evidence, observable on a wide-scale. Anecdotes can be insightful, but they have no place supporting an argument for or against.Demonstrates basic critical thinking skills.Novel arguments or reasoning, which aren’t widely seen in any one of the thousands of This album vs. That album threads scattered across this forum already. Seriously, I don’t want to read arguments I’ve heard a hundred times, especially if you can’t offer up any sort of new information to support these arguments.Otherwise, this debate really has almost nothing to do with which album is actually “better”, so don’t expect to get an easy win just because you lucked out with a critically/commercially claimed album. Along those same lines, I’m expecting even more from you if you do have a favorable match up

Arobie1992:

Pretty much everything SR covered looks good. Here's some stuff I specifically wanted to address for my judging criteria:The argument being made is more important than the format of the entry, though I am somewhat partial to essays.If the entry is in essay format, I'm looking for good usage of grammar and writing. It doesn't have to be perfect, but there shouldn't be simple typos (e.g. apart vs. a part, alot instead of a lot, etc.). Follow the rules here and you'll be good.Arguments should aim for objectivity. Entirely subjective reasoning will only serve to hurt your argument.I highly recommend using outside sources, which should be referred to.Able to relate different aspects to each other (e.g. social impact to commercial success).Demonstrate an understanding of each of the aspects you discuss beyond a basic level. So for example, if you talk about lyrical quality, discuss why the lyrics are better than your opponent's album's lyrics.Length is irrelevant. The submission should be as long as you feel it needs to be to cover everything you want to discuss in adequate depth, but no longer.Again, the goal of this is not whose album is better, but who can provide the more well-reasoned, compelling argument for why their album is better/more important/whatever. As SR said, just because you have what you, or even many, may consider to be a superior album, don't expect to be able to slack. If it's famous, it's famous for a reason, and we're going to expect you to know, understand, and articulate those reasons clearly and concisely

MrXercules:

To be added

HashSlingingSlasher:

Here are some of the things I am looking for:Good, solid evidence. Don't just include your opinions, even if you can back those opinions up. You should also give some statistics, expert opinions, etc. Something that is actually hard, solid evidence, and not just subjectiveClarity of ideas. Make sure that you explain yourself thoroughly. Remember, this can be as long as you like, so don't be afraid to be wordy. Make sure that you ideas are well thought out and easy to understand. If you can't explain an idea well, or can't support it enough, then that is probably a sign that the idea isn't really good enough to be included. A thesis statement might be a good idea hereI'm a bit of a grammar nazi. You don't have to be 100% right 100% of the time, but at least make it evident that you really attempted to have correct grammar and spelling. Remember, spellcheck is your friend, and if you really aren't good with grammar, then you could always have someone else read your writing to make sure it is correctFocus on all aspects of your album. Not just the lyricism, or the flow. Get into the producing as well. Make sure you know your album like you know the back of your hand. Discuss every part of it that you think proves it's greatnessJust like in any debate, don't leave any ""chinks in your armor"", so to speak. If your album has a weak point, don't just try to ignore it, or your opponent (and myself) will notice. Don't try to sweep things under the rug. If you are leaving holes in your defense, they will be found and exploited

And most of all...Proofread! Seriously, this is one of my pet peeves. After you are ""done"", read through your essay a few times. Any grammatical errors? Any spelling errors? Any ideas that don't seem well thought out or that seem skimpy? Keep reading through it until you don't find anything that you want to changeAfarese:

Basically everything the other judges said will apply for me as well, but here are the things I will most be looking at:Good grammar. It doesn't have to look like an English scholar wrote it, but it should have few mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Mixing up ""there"" with ""they're"" or ""to"" and ""too"" should be avoidedDemonstrates a good amount of knowledge on how the album impacted hip-hopThe argument should not be subjective and state just opinions, the argument should be objective and state factsUses outside information, such as commercial performance, critical reception, or professional reviews. Not mandatory but highly recommendedDemonstrates that the album was listened to and analyzed, and argument well thought out rather than just being thrown togetherAlso, as stated before this is not about who's album is better. An argument could be a great album vs a terrible album, but if the terrible album's argument is explained better then it will win. The more well thought out argument that shows that you listened to the album and analyzed it well","rap","Judges Criteria","2024-07-27T18:05:12.534083Z","0.0","0.0",2014

Once upon a time not long ago
There was man named T-TIME and he was bold
He gifted the world with an Animay mixtape
Now back again to show, VOL 1 was no mistake
He hath awaken from his slumber
Gathered up all #THAGODSQUAD members
TO PRESENT TO YOU FANS. THAT
ALL DAY ANIMAY. VOL-

Looking back I only thought about me staying the back
Rolled off with the shit got a K in the back

Niggas better salute the truth never play em for whack
Feel like i’m sinking i was stuck in the rain
Can’t change voices in ma head yelling ma name
This dreams was all in ma mental nothing was gentle
Swiss here tryna stay on track no instrumental
All they ever got was bad news brother in the cell doing mandatory life
Tell the judge go to hell i’m in guerilla no never take no nights off
All they do is rap, thuggin till they lights off

As the feeling just fades off, and the days just seem long
You seen the victims of it, yeah its harder to ween off
And two fingers ain’t no solution, you tryna clean off
A facade that ain’t really there, its yourself you can’t really bear

To the realest of all friends, who be with you till the end

They hurt you, but they be losing, cuz you the one that be worth it

You not the one to be hurting, no

Told you open up, told you that you do mean everything

Said you got nobody, you still got me but you

Stand up on your own two, breathe in when its O2

I could write up a hunnet songs, and keep workin in pro tools
Keep telling you old news, been trying to show you
But you good at nodding along, been facadin’ for so long
Its you who gotta do different, already I see a difference yeah
I hate to see you burn, I hate when you be off again
I hate when you don’t learn, I hate when they go out without ya
But wait cuz its your turn, you’ll make it you’ll be laughing at

But my vision’s getting hella blurry and unclear
Head is spinning like a windmill, but dont worry
You know I’m on a mission
I’m just trying to see if you can work for me and right now is your audition

It wouldn’t be a hot beat, unless we put Wasted on it
Got a bed with them fine sheets, me and your girl get wasted on it
No pad no pen, just want paper with faces on it
Pounds of the reefer shouldn’t even have to say we on it

Murder the illest with type of shit I be spittin’ bitch
I could get your ass killed and have your ho go and dig the ditch
Wasted Beats pretty, yeah pretty wasted up in this bitch
You can tell I’m getting money cuz my palms and my fingers itch
Man I’m teaching the best, and I’m schooling the rest
I feed these hungry bitches cereal but never my Chex
I could get her the best, but I won’t let’s be honest
I been saying money over bitches since I first got hooked on phonics

This life I’m living pretty mane, I know it is
And I know I rep my city I would die for this shit
Rather take no bitch than my old bitch, everybody been in that like a foam pit
And I am so sky high I swear I don’t even know what low is

At this point, I truly hate the rich girl
She told on me for dropping an eraser. What a snitch girl
The rich boy just got expelled
But I don't really care and I don't wish them well
Cause he bought all the Minecraft books Scholastic had in stock
And his dad bought all the toys that I ever could've bought
It's the new Scholastic Book Fair and there's chaos where it's at
So once you finish checking out you better run and watch your back
Still going to the book fair and I'm tired of trying
It's like Dababy on baby except it's fighting on fighting
Cause there's young crazies with rabies outside trying and trying
To take all of your items after you just finish buying

Also, for the record, I know Scholastic is spelled wrong. So, if you guys could just stop messaging me about i-

[Chorus]
Ay the Scholastic Book Fairs climbing
But it's coming back not quiet
It's a nightmare when elementary kids learn about violence
In the middle school
Think they're a little cool when they're despicable
They'll steal your nostalgia and trade it for a little ridicule

[Verse 2]
A little kid came up; was like age 9
Was reading records from Guinness; was like page 9
He said, ""Can I have a look?"" so I handed over the book
Until he ran off with what he took
The ripped Vans of a smuggy crook
I chased the kid to the door of his mother's car
Cause I was just about to finish the page with Tony Hawk
Ran close then I got him
He dropped it. I caught it
Worth it even though I think my ribs just got kicked in

They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity

Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)

Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?

Alright
Fuckin oath
Let's go

[Verse]
I saw this post by Karat Kev saying ""Think about your impact
What do you do for your community, do you give back?""
Anyone can kick phat slick raps
Bunch of fuckin pissants talking bout they shivs dacked, that shit's wack
I ain't ever flipped packs, I just try to kick facts
Motherfuckers break under pressure just like a Kit-Kat
Saw your little track and I just skipped that
Motherfuckers stupid and I bet they never fuckin heard a Nip track
That's real talk
It's like it isn't 'bout the art no more
It's all about your designer clothes and the cars you got
Intelligence isn't respected no more and it makes me sick
But I'm thе artist that they was asking for
But just be hard and raw, that's that normal shit
What is normal shit? I guess it's fuckin talking shit
Going on Instagram, posting a bit of corny shit
Start a beef with somеone, go back and forth for the audience, performing it
When one you lose, the'll applaud the shit
Remember when it's all said and done, no one talkin it like Jordan is
And imma never fuckin call it quits
And fuck you to anyone praying that I be falling cause I won't
I'm tryna give the youth some hope
Let you know you ain't alone, stay strong, untie the rope, it ain't a joke
We all tryna stay afloat, but the doctors don't understand us, they give us pills to cope and that's a joke
And as I'm rowing in this boat
Paddling against my depression, I'm sinking in this moat and I just mope, yeah
And I ain't got the right words to say
Everytime I think of fuckin speaking I just choke, and that's the realest shit I ever spoke
I been tryna get clean but I keep dropping the soap
So I smoke to stay high all the time to get by with my life
I don't really wanna die, so I'm high all the time to stop thinking
Cause I'm numb to the pain, I'm thinking fuck the fame
Motherfuckers try to come at me, I've dug up my grave
My split personalities are fuckin one in the same
I saw this post by Karat Kev, got me thinking bout my legacy
Will my enemies remember me? Wanna be legendary
I'm tryna be something that they will never be
I let em in, I let em see everything inside of me till I rest in peace
And I made it pop without ever making a melody
Let's go, ARGHHHH
[Outro]
Hahaha
Almost lost my fuckin breath, cunt
Haha
This shit forever bro, my shit will never die

I'm in this bitch like I don't give a fuck, I've got an extra pair of testicles
I fuck your bitch then fall asleep on the couch with my draws and the tv on
That afternoon I killed you first, then cut up the corpse with Stevie Stone
Life in the jungle wasn't shit that my mama could teach
Should've used a coat hangar to kill me when I was a fetus
Go eat a Snickers cause you rappers just bitches and beavers
Fucking cupcakes, faggots with feminine features
I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis
After we take the organs out then we mail them to Jesus

I think my ex is satan in the flesh, long hair, nails and a dress
Prolly caught a n**** slippin but who cares, I digress
Why you all up in my mental with your stank-ass breath
Just another n**** you fucked, another nut, who’s next?
I was pumpin ‘til I erupted on your flat-ass chest
And use a rubber and use nothing I was searching for death
Searching for love that’s why i smothered you is not complex
We used to choke each other when we fucked to cut off our breath
Syrens sung a song to Homer just to cut off his neck
Erykah Badu had Common wearing crocheted hats
For every Yoko there’s a Heather Mills collecting a check
For every rapper there’s a groupie scheming on the event
Love is more a game of questions, not quite a game of chance
Better yet, a game of patience no answers in romance
Better yet, it’s not a game for you it’s more a tournament
You place your issues over pride, you put your present verse’ your past
Ot was lust in the first place I was scared that it would last
Couple nuts in a dirty telly room over by graham street
Came and you want your birthday that was your gift
We both supposed to be responsible adults, look at this shit
Was I just another n****? Were you just another bitch?
Was it just another memory or caution lost in bliss?
Wouldn't ask you to stay ‘cause that’d just be forcing shit
Now what I really wanna know is…
Who are you really?

Who is more to blame...or who is more subject to this
The male gender, or the female gender
Not being able to pick up crazy on an attractive motherfucker

Because men have been socialized to hit it and quit it
(sometimes, unless it’s too good, then they can’t— they wanna keep hitting and—)
I will say
(they like playing with fire)
I’m guilty of that
See first off you have to understand the male science

The science of man-ness is
“The best way for me to understand her is to fuck her”

Woke up in Atlanta
With a zip full of xannies and blood on my clothes

I’d stay up out the cameras 
But how the fuck can I?
Never meant to upset her
She screaming who am I?
The truth is, I don’t even know
How come whenever I say that shit out loud I fear I’ve died 
Maybe I should put this gun in my mouth now and clear my mind
But before I can greet death
I just tell myself “deep breaths, you just need rest”
Lay down and relieve stress
Then wake up and repeat steps
At night my disorder, it come through the Ouija

One to hold me down, one I can count on

Sophisticated school girl
Be on my block
Rocking bracelets, anklets the basics
Petite nice body, skin and face sick
One I could shop with
Go uptown and cop with
She not a thug girl but my down chick
She know how to roll the weed but don't smoke
She know how to cook the coke and bag dope
Screen my calls
Flip on me when I'm wrong
Talk shit through the night
Throw it on me on the morn'
She like it from the back
With my fingers in her hair
I love it in any position
Ma, I don't care

And drive by the projects while a nigga hollar

She back out the step
When yo niggers crowd around
That's my road dog
And you know I unload for her
She hold me down anytime I call for her
Like at the time when I crashed the Jag
She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With ten grand shopping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive
Put a Glock on the dash, nigga

You saluteable Jesus feet, glow like the furnace
Voice like Rushin’ waters of Vodka from a thermos
Half baked brain case, love how your dame taste
You sour as welfare milk weeks beyond the keep dates
Blunts is snake skin coils, I gotta alotta top soil
Throw it on coffins, with nails from Mosque Halls
Swim-fan bitches, pools of pre-cum in my britches
Wipe it on her fat ass, fuck tissues
Prominent son of Mary, Ossuary Pen, stole the rhythm
Ran through these bars like I escaped prison
I’ve risen like locust in the mausoleum Seal
Terrorize lines like Wu signs in Mel Gibson fields","rap","To the Table","2024-07-28T10:37:46.673159Z","-0.4","0.4",2005

Bout to pound a bitch, that I couldn’t smash, if I didn’t prey on the gram like I could in mass
I need an angel ass with waist tall tats
Can take all that, and make hoes yack, and wake up smacked
Your face all cracked like eight Ball smacks
Cause we don’t bat a fuckin’ eye, unless it’s with a fuckin’ baseball bat

Ima kill this thing whether you with me or not
[Verse 3]
They never coming round til they see you blowing up
I gave your tape a listen and I started throwing up
Shoutout to the people that I had back when I sucked
Good thing I ain't give this up because I'm finally going up
They clapping when I arrive
Lately I been on a rise
Adrenaline in my veins when I'm rapping keeps me alive
Lately my life's been a ride
I'm rocking a lot of vibes
All they talk about is money, I can see right through your lies
Buddy I ain't got the time for your BS
ADHD attention span short as Zacchaeus
Only reason that they hate us cause they wanna be us
I knew I was meant for greatness ever since a fetus
Can't wait til the day I can do this everyday
Thanking God when I pray, always got a lot to say
Ain't afraid to knock you down if you ever in my way
Ain't afraid of any demons, when I die I'll elevate aye

At least that's what I feel
You see an opportunity to help someone who's sick
I see a chance to be a dick
I can't change the way I am
But I feel like if I fake it till I make it I can be better
But what if some people aren't meant to be better
I'm meant to be a hater
Shit on Billie Ellish because my ex liked her
Hate on your decisions cuz I don't have enough confidence to make my own
I'd be willing to give away the little that I own if it means my cold heart would part from my chest
I wish I could be normal like the rest
But I'm just me
Some people tell me to embrace it
Write my poetry and ignore the hared
But I can't ignore the hatred when its in my head
Saying that I'm better off dead
Telling me to grab a Glock and fill myself with led
I'm fed up with dreams
I'm fed up with disappointment
But there is no cure
Or no ointment
I'm just a bad guy, a bad guy
I'm just a bad person I don't know why I try
Make my girl cry, my girl cry

I don't know why I am how I am

Wanna grab a gun and make it go blam
Make it go blam

Wish I could go back to when I wasn't suicidal every day
All mama wants to do is help my pain go away
Maybe I should go back to the hospital
Talk to a therapist about how I'm so non-committal in every relationship
My emotions like to do a flip
Make my ego as hard as a brick
I swear I don't know how I look in the mirror that long
The thought of talking to myself makes me sick
Crack in the mirror
I feel my fear seeking out of my head
I'm getting sent to a bad place
Somewhere worse than being dead
""Hello Joseph""
Shit Satan's back inside my head
""You wonder why you are this way
But you should know
God didn't influence your actions any day
He gave you free will I just manipulate it
Now here take a seat
Let me pull up a chair
Your friend's feelings are on a plate
Would you like me to share?
You can stare at me in hatred all you want
But it still won't change all the times you were a cunt

So take heed and be wise, Cause the wrong way and you'll die, And you'll never have the second chance to be a real man

Mankind caught up in a cycle of apathy
Absent of passion and fear unhappily
Consuming the greater part of our energy exactly
What is the purpose of the secret service
There had to be a plan of the wicked to paralyze the intellect
Will Generation X survive the internet?
Microwave knowledge to benefit, been a threat
Third eye blind mystically illiterate
Ignorant impossible to expect me to give a shit
Hearing me calling conspiracy theory in fear we follow
Mentally weary it's
Tyranny over the mind's memory
But a well designed enemy
Clinically brain scattered
Chemically imbalanced
Express malice, such untapped talents
Told what we know with an immense challenge
Look at those to control this is all out madness
Keeping us from the knowledge
Let us suffer in silence
Terminating the vermin there's veterans of the violence
Reaching for what's inside us
No one is gonna guide us
Don't see the obvious or don't bother looking behind us
Keeping in mind to how fine Nicki Minaj is
Or Louis Vuitton see the sign to the designers
Will they design a new bomb to drop on us
New microchips, satellites and narcotics
It's crazy, we puppets
Tap into Twitter and trigger our favorite topics
Big Brother babysitter create subjects
Got us all on the hook any moment they gonna gut us
As long as we look at stars there's something up above us
We lack perspective, see that deception

You may say you’re walkin’ up the street
Packin’ heat at the people you meet
But I don’t care I don’t shed a tear
Nigga, you could be the best of the worst
Just, be by my side be a witness to the curse
Never be the source
In the realist of the situation
Why do the nations, war against nations?
When did it all begin?
Homie when will it end
I’ve seen the generation’s high intentions
It seems like
Total destruction
Is the only solution
To ease the tension
Bob Marley mentioned that
There ain’t no stoppin’
Ain’t nobody who can stop ‘em
You’ve gotta do ya thing don’t get caught up in the system
We gave, Babylon one inch and they took a yard
Give ‘em a yard now they’re takin’ a mile
Don’t cry
Once a man and twice a child
Everythin’ is for awhile
Don’t be takin’ it high
False prophets come preachin’ just to fool ya so they can rule
That’s why I kill with the rockets
I don’t care I ain’t got a conscience
When I demonstrate is for once ‘cause there’s no second chance
Focus ya mind

From the east the coast chose me now I’ve got the toast
I was born in the west but I represent the east
Brookfields, Freetown, from where came the beast
I learned the game from the homies that’ll never put the heat down
Out of control, we could never let the streets down
These niggas don’t know what they do
It’s unusually true
They’ve got me losin’ my cool
Player haters in the game and they’re scared of competition
Fuck rap, ghetto niggas got their own ambitions
So when a wack Mamma Jamma tries to rock the mic
I lose passion
Get the punk out of my sight
Don’t wanna listen to ya message
I’m lynchin’ off ya nut bag seed with the essence
I can’t help it
Yo I hate these haters when they’re trippin’

Ready to desert my home
With the hoochies, cause daddy wouldn’t let me roam

Because I’ve got nothin’ to lose
Except for my life and it worthless
The shit is gettin’ hopeless
Cause the leaders had to rogue us
Shit the bogus
No job for the lawyers, and intellectuals
After slavery, the white man deserted us
Watchin’ our currency drop and bleedin’ soldiers
Yo the rebels, they want human rights more than twice so they slice up
And if you don’t like it you’ll get diced up

Always ready to give in to temptation
My niggas better watch ya step
Always ready to give in to temptation

They asked me how did I get noticed when no one promoted you, ha
Man, the fans is who I owe it to, fans win the show for you
Layin' in Japan, well the plan is to be global, fool
When you universal, it's hard for these record executives not to Tommy Mottola you
It's cool when they tell me ain’t nobody cold as you
They'll even load a gun and go to war for you
I told Mercedes, when you in a Benz
It's always a Toyota Corolla that wanna come total you
So my appearance is a humblin' experience
Put the album out myself, shorty, I don’t need a clearance
Tryna to block my route, dawg, we call that interference

Pussy run the world
Spending time on a girl
Who knows that she runs shit
Regret getting her digits
And even then I still fidget
Because I fucked around
I'm an addict looking for a fix
Hmmm, yeah she caught wind of it
Got me like bark on a tree
I ain't leaving it
Crazy one with thick thighs and shy eyes
No wonder she don't hang with them other guys
And I'm just so high, I'm not any other guy, so lets just fly
We've been through so much
Can't we just get along?
I know I made so many songs
I'm just tryna right my wrongs
I miss kissing up on you and playing with your lace thong
Fuck the pain, 'til it's all gone
And you know what your boy been on
It's been more lit than xenon
And any track I drop, these people feind on
Don't you get it? I'm a phenom
Just tryna see your nasty side, I'm a demon
Tell me have I ever done you wrong? Yes? Girl, come on
Always been about you, shit ain't changed
But why the fuck do you gotta keep playing
Would you miss me if I got on a plane
And it crashed before it touched the ground again?
[Bridge]
Turn off the lights
But I'm trying to turn you on
Don't stress the details
Word to Marvin Gaye, baby girl, let's get it on

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know, shit dont make sense
Eyes closed, eyes closed, alot on your mind
I will keep you under my wings
I'm nasty in the sheets
You're my everything
Eat you up, looking sweet
Baby, I see rain in your eyes
Laughter in your hands
And I know sometimes I don't understand
How you're feeling
But I'm out here, making a killing
No one as strong and beautiful to me than you
Tell me what you're feeling
This the type of love
Make you think about her every morning
And afternoon, and evening
And night
You thinking about marriage
No doubt, shit I might
Give you that ring
Give you that ring
Shit so shiny
I don't know how you found me
But I'm not so lost, Mami
I'd rather want you on me than around me
You're my everything
The one I'll come to when its time for settling
But for now I'm flying with these wings
My earth child, you're so far, but so close
You look beautiful with or without clothes
You're a little crazy, and a little lazy

Kicking writtens off the top it’s a given I won’t flop
Half the rappers in the game just gimmicks, (gimmick)
I’m not
Yeah time flies, I been at this for only a year
And now I’m showing signs of life cause I’m the only one here
All my crew got lost and found they own other paths
Turns out it was just me who wanted to rap
Lit the flame and burned a bridge with a couple of friends
Turns out they didn’t wanna see me in the ends
Never worked so hard to prove anyone wrong before
Then I went off just feasting like a carnivore
Always played the end of the joke but it didn’t appear
Now I understand and that’s the whole reason i’m here
Mind pains was the song had 1 and a 2
Went from recording on phones to getting hundreds of views
Now I climbed my way up to the top of tho food chain
Then the golden age came yeah I’m talking the new thing
(just playing)
A person told me that they fucking with the movement I got
I appreciate it cause I work and do this a lot
I think they like my shit more than me it’s really a pain
But I got 800 plays I mean who can complain
Cause every time I drop some shit and it come from the heart
And really love what i made for once feeling smart
Then I barely get played and I can’t understand
The world slipping away from the palms of my hands
Cause i don’t wanna be a sell out, but how can I sell out
When i’m the only one liking the shit I’m about
And it’s all in my mind tryna get me some clout
When my closest friends don’t support me when I’m around
And it’s all the basic shit that’s gon get all the plays
And i lied to myself when I said I’m not fazed
And they all love the kid i am fucking amazed
I don’t even get the credit when he steal a whole page
I’m the mastermind, the ghostwriter, supporter & and chief
And yet it’s times when I’m feeling I don’t wanna be me
Cause I rather be the one in the light all the time
But the real shit I make never get any shine
I'm just tryin'
And I lie all the time, when I say that I’m fine
Cause the fame in the spot not gon wait til it’s mine
People cutting me off can’t even spit a line
And the clock is running low right now ain’t no time
[Verse 2: Anarky]
Survivors guilt I be living in a cave
Til' this bullshit came around and started new waves
Everybody wanna rap now, be a lil' whatever
Who the fuck gave them the game? Now they gon' get it forever
Cause as long as nobody care as listeners do
Like chance 3 we gon' see hella dread-head dudes

But your feelings weren't true

How you can just fake it
I cant take it

Talking all this fake shit
Took my heart to break it
And say this wasn't it

Led me to a land

Tear that shit apart

This is a duel — a showdown
Mr. Rebel vs. Mr. Gravity
What up Mr. Gravity? I just got some words for you

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. Gravity, what up, I see you took off
Now you bigger than ever but to
Me it's like you took off
Clocked out, no longer a witness to the nations
Are you playing the background or really fame chasing
You sold out, used to
Be souled out
Now you just tweeting 'bout how your concert was sold out
Dudes be making songs talking bout that they all worry bout you
I'mma keep it real, my stomach turns at your current route
Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't mean so much to me
Your music changed me, now it's just disgusting me
And I assume it's the fame and the money, power and influence
You just tryna be accepted, headed to your ruin
And me? I'm just doing what you was known for doing
Bringing the truth hard
Hoping that it gets through
Somebody had to say it, might as well be me
And P.S. please don't corrupt KB
[Bridge]
Wow, that's how you feel Mr. Rebel?
I mean.. it's all love in grace but let me just talk to you

[Verse 2]
Ay look, dear Mr. Rebel
Young brother I understand
You feel like I let you
Down, like I'm misguiding all these fans
Truth is I feel arrogant and even self consumed
Explaining my motives to all
Of these people who've assumed
It's not about the money and trust me, I hate fame
Made some interesting moves while playing this chess game
And honestly did change, but never for the change
Maturity's given me liberties that I wouldn't claim
Some of the very things I used to call abomination
Are things I couldn't handle but thank the Lord for His grace
I ask you to be gracious, people ain't always shaky
Some have different convictions and others gon' make mistakes
I'm a little bit of both and I ain't mad or offended
You can forgive much when you understand you forgiven
I done a lot of living, misjudged many people
Quicker to call 'em evil before
I knew 'em as people
I'm less self righteous, not seeker sensitive
The truth is we all deserved to die the way that Jesus did
I don't wanna make every song into a sermon
Go listen to your pastor, that's where you should be learning
I love you, I'm sorry that I'm not the man you think I am
But it was never me anyway, it's the great I Am
[Outro]
Ay man, I still believe everything I wrote on Rebel, you know what I mean?
Me bragging about where I been or what kinda mission trips I'm doing
And who I'm discipling and so on and so forth in every song doesn't make me more holy
And me not talking about it doesn't make me less holy
It's all grace baby, I hope we can have graces with me as the Lord has been gracious to us all
I love you","rap","Rebel vs. Gravity","2024-07-28T17:17:56.791514Z","-0.4","-0.3",2013

[Hook]
Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night
I’m looking for happiness in a place that’s not right
So I take my dollars, but that don’t make much sense
So I head for the light, Head for the light

[Verse 1]
For my pick-six of life I pay the price
Comes with a dollar sign of the fucking times
Write my rhymes so I can pay my piper
Slow nose grind, call me a fighter
Unenthusiastic on the curb of life
So you'll have to Hold me down when you dump the ice
Cause Failure happens no more than twice
But success isn't always right
I'll Take my hits and rewrite and fight
The limelight set piece shines so bright
The concept is driven by my motivation
Power on and lead my fucking generation
Afraid of the consequences of doubt
Doing my best to figure it all out
The voodoo that I do make me sharp like ginsu
So you should beware when I slice right in you
And Approach the top with my peers and we feast
Walk through the valley heat with bare feet
The naked fire simmers leaving a hot streak
Penitentiary ambitions lead to defeat
The pain and struggle that stays on repeat
The arguments happen due to conceit
Overcome the struggles and leave with relief
Keep it short man boxers or brief
Cause the Adversary of peace never leaves relief
In the hands of those who struggle to be free
So take away all of the things that we seek
And you will leave people feeling helpless and weak
Struggle to the peak
Crouch below the surface
Peer up at your peers
Fight all of the madness spawned by your fears
This is our struggle
This is our fight
Our anthem rings on into the night
[Hook]
Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night
I’m looking for happiness in a place that’s not right
So I take my dollars it don’t make much sense
And I head for the light, Head for the light

[Verse 2]
My baby girls left she’s all outta sight
That’s what I get for being so bright
I don't care no more cause she outta mind
So I take what's mine and I Head for the light
She said leave me a sign something to help change my mind
Cause I’m stumbling blind trying to hide my pride
Cause I know I’m not right to have been so egregious to ya! Jesus!
But what can I say this is the game that I play as
Commiserative phantoms sing Promissory anthems
They Start by humming
Then Start the chanting
So I start the dancing
As They lift my soul
We Throttle the night stand
We Rock n roll
I hurt
But never cry
Pain hides behind smiles
Apothecary based Visions of sadness Cloud my mind
This is the madness that we hide inside
This is the pain I strive to fight
This is the choice that I made for life
These are the people that I love for life
Show me some thing worth the fight
Give to me the happiness I'm worth tonight!

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling so cheezy
The air is so breezy
The wind on my face feels like your touch
Your lack of a presence
Is making me question
All that I have cause you were my crutch
I need your opinion
I'm feeling resentment
I crave every chance to look in your eyes
Your mystery scares me
Oh how it dares me
Pushing and pulling on my mind
Your are so perfect
It's making me nervous
I need to calm my nerves in a rush
I'm begging and pleading
Oh your misleading
All of my moves are all but crushed

So Baby Please!!
Look deep in your heart
Cause I have
Loved you from the start
And I Know x3
I know it's true
That what I have
Was made for you!!

There ain't nothing bad that I ever did for you
For you, for you, for you

So would you please
Could You Please
Tell me what you think
About the choice I made
That's put me on the brink
Cause I know x3
I know I need You
And You Know x3
You always will too
So let's go
Let's go far
Away from all that is hard
And I'll show you
Whats deep in my heart
And you'll see
It's been there from the start
So let's go

But they seemed to tell me prisoners are at ease
I'm caught in a bit of a Seattle freeze
But who is corrupt
Potentially, all of us
The way these punishments vary provides cries, provides wise
Provides the ability to apologize
Look at the eyes of your eyes
I'm just continuing to assume
A wise man once told me we are too focused on what's flashy
We were stuck in a valley
Exploration for humanity continuous for planetary advancement
But I just assume it's at a permanent expansion
Or at least to our understanding
I don't have a source of entrancement
Maybe this is it
Still we don't have the will
At least we will fight with you for the bill
A mix of laziness yet ultimate skill
That's what stops us from finding thrill
Maybe once we get over beverly hills
We can feel
What will be coming

That’s right, hello
This has got me all blue even though it's called yellow
I keep focusing on what I won't see, so
I'll continue to watch you shine, but me i'll glow
I seem to prefer the intros
I am just playing ping-pong
With the idea of king-kong
I think physical pain is my motivation to be at the top, while the rest is just a test of whether my will can be still strong
I'm gone, so long
You can't talk to me, I'm too busy studying the stars
Or reading the Qur’an on mars
Or writing bad bars on what's behind their bars waiting for us inside our hearts
I used to spend my time creating by looking at your cards
In school that's cheating but in the real world it's part of it all
So don't let me fall
I know that i'm gonna call I know that you aren't gonna respond to my brawl
So just continue to stall from ignorance
But where is that place we can reach blissfulness
When we connect sites the idea of finding at Atlantis isn't too ridiculous
Continue to misinterpret what's mandatory and drown yourself in alcohol
We weren't ready to have Willy Wonka in the long haul
The year is 1389
And proof is given that predicted the moonlight
And give or take 50 years later I was listening to sunshine
That’s right
I have got a 6th sense
I can understand the light
Different frequencies, different colors on the spectrum aren’t just in my sight, but are 100% understood in my mind
What you can't put into words, I can just fine
Apparently I have the right to die 77 times and that's not a crime
So i'll continue to try and find
The signs
Hit up chapter 5 and head to the 32nd
Then tell me that I need to start repenting
They don't understand the message we are sending
But this has all happened before and it will happen again
What we need is slowly killing us, don't you forget
Did we not give them evidence?
Their insults are irrelevant, nothing except what they'll accept
From the fiddler we got more than they expected
I'm not a Mandinka warrior but tears don't come from their descendants
Supposedly like Malcolm X
You're so smart, so intelligent
For things we didn't do, we want credit
I think i'm gonna fade away like Logic
Or disappear like Tyrell Wellek
Instead of finding myself stressed like Tom Selleck
One day we will stumble upon an ancient relic
That'll prove Alavi right, and all of the sceptics
Will still find a way to forget it
I just, just hope they won't regret it
But I respect it
Yeah
I just suggest you
Listen but I expect you
To expect me to protect you

I was mad dipped
Butterfly collars and shit
Chains from the slave ship
Dreads with the wave kit
Bifocals and wing tips
Velvet pants and a velour coat
Looked in the mirror
""Damn, I look dope""
Folded up the singles in my loot-clip
Put a sock in my pants on some Uncle Luke shit
Dressed to impress, now I'm ready to go
The club is twelve blocks away and I got no loot, so
I walk ten and take a cab for two
Black duct tape over the hole in my shoe
I've got the hottest dance steps
Running Man, Cabbage Patch plus The Robocop
Then I'll bring back The Wop
Jaws will drop and all the ladies will flock
Brothers thinking (What he got that I ain't got?)
I'll tell ya, fella
It's written in my bestseller
It started to rain
Shit, I got no umbrella
The walking turned to running
Still, I look stunning
Covered 'nuff ground before my taxi was summoned (Hey, taxi)
Got to the spot and hopped out at the front
Tripped over the curb, limping, 'cause my toes were stubbed
Then I tried to give pounds to people I didn't know (Yo, what's up, y'all?)
Like Lucy and Joe
My destination was the back do'
Not because the bouncer told me not to come back
I'm just sneaking in the club, because I got it like that
[Verse 2: Insight]
I remember when you used to be broke
Ignored when you spoke
And people would take you for a joke
You used to go to the club
And look like a scrub
But couldn't afford the admission
From outside, you're looking in
Waiting for a chance to slip by
You slide through the back door
But you wasn't supposed to be there
You'd look like an idiot if you got caught
But you didn't care
Just as long as you got your groove on
It was smooth sailing
They was playing the Thong Song
You're feeling shorty with the boots on
Cutting through the crowd sideways, it's time to move strong
To cool kick it, say something slick off the top
Flash your jewels, fix your suit
Fidgeting with your wristwatch (Mhmm)
But right when you was in the corner acting a big shot
They threw on some hiphop
People got on the dance floor
And a bouncer saw you standing at the corner near the door (Hey, you)
He started walking your way, to muscle you out
Since you refused to pay
So there was nothing for you to say
When he blew up your spot (I told you not to come back here)
And threw you out the front to the floor
Past the bar on the right through the double doors
You mumbled and swore, stumbled and tripped on the pavement (Goddamn)
People in line started laughing
When they threw you hat then
Screaming that you wasn't allowed back in
But that was back then, acting like nothing happened
You patted your Tims off, depressed from embarrassment
It could have been fresh, it would have been lavish
One day you'll make it and won't have to deal with this madness

High five, scientists!
Deal exclusively in blind spot and hindsight biases
And let me highlight this bit before I'm misunderstood
Yes, you can be this smart and look this good
Ya followin' me, camera guy?
Let's talk showbiz
Next time you see a street performer, don't give
That's called enabling
And you don't wanna get roped into
Some no talent hack's vain attempt to feign emotion
No offense
But that's the dishonest truth! Take it from me
A bloke with a chip on his shoulder and a chip on his tooth
Bully ball. Is that ref Hellen Keller? She should've called!
Greetings from the past, before America was fully walled
Greetings from the future after Buchenwald
I'm just kidding, Germany. You know I love your… guten tag
I don't rap fast, you listen slow. Half-time the video
Anti politico. Pro fat guy in a little coat
Triple jeopardy. Triple major in
Hidden Temple teams, Hitler empathy
And rectal hysterectomy
Batten down your snatches
I'm leavin' blood stains on AIDS quilt patches
It's all good in the woods until you play with matches
Deoxys Raikou Clefairy Trapinch
I’m just hangin’ on my balcony
Wrapped in a blanket with Paris Jackson
Talkin’ about how framed her dad is
Here’s a headline for ya:
“mr. master found dead inside-”
I got fans who’d jump in front of a bullet that I loaded
Who turn ultra up loud as they
Avoid eye contact with the homeless
The sticker’s the only reason they voted
And they know to spill the Kool Aid on the ground
And never keep up with the Joneses
Atta boy/girl/prefer not to answer!
Now you’re microwaving with hamsters!
You deserve a pat on the-
Y’know what? You deserve an entire Terry frisk pat search
Just keep your hands on the vehicle
I need to hide my badge first
You're not allowed to say everyone sounds the same
If you sound exactly like someone else
That being said
Everyone sounds the same!
Welp, I guess I have to blaze this trail by myself!
Rappers, I beg of you. If you’re going to commit identity theft
At least thieve from the best
Please, jock my steez! I insist, just leave me a little cred
Drop this vid into EasyBib and keep me in your cited texts
But then again, this style is kinda one size fits one, no?
It’s an art writing smart punchlines this dumb... ho
But did you see the invisible gorilla though? Rewind the video!
There’s so much more to ultra than you think you know!
A bottomless WaPo Pinocchio Rapid T Rabbithole
That chewed up Andy Warhol and spat out Andy Ngo
Teachable moment!
Next time, don’t let Fox News loose in a white-painted henhouse
And let bygones be rights wronged you never forget about
If all my parts unknown fell through
I'd tie a noose in a French hotel too
And now that we're all miserable

Let me talk my shit

[Verse 1]

Inbound moving as fast as a greyhound
Drink with the heat and I'm safe and she stay sound
I'm black I don't lack, on my head is a straight crown
I swim with the sharks ask around I don't play round (Not at all)
Kicking down the doors in my hand is the tre pound
Straight bars, ain't the only thing in my playground
On the streets is a gown I was fully committed (Committed)
Prime time seemed so distant but was written
With no limits quicker than Amazon shipments (That prime)
The route was short distance gas mileage efficient
Quit the game raised my hand then enlisted (Salute)
Got black listed them streets got resistant
Mad at me cuz I got a check that's consistent
Glad to be that nigga that grinded and persisted (Never stop)
Freed that slave in me did it-close fisted
Cost me everything now my brain is all twisted
[Chorus]

You bolted down, I'll take u off da ground (Off the ground)
You balling now, I got a crib it's underground
It’s for sale you couldn’t even hear when the (Thunder growl)
Send my animals inbound they'll be on the prowl
There's no rules or even out of bounds we not calling fouls
Ain’t a game, I don’t care you turned your life around
The wolves coming, Yup, I told em’ not to howl
They will stop the tick on your wrist (That’s a quiet dial)

[Verse 2]

Imbalance I don't need it I need teaching (I need that)
No violence so quit leaching I'll breed demons (Demon time)
To find you and sit you down for a brief meeting
Bought a dozen of them ovens that is preheating
This what you get, get pistol whipped have your soul leaning
Don't double dip I'll get you flipped better quit dreaming (Stop that)
Won’t trip cuz’ we out here giving out (Nightmares)
Don't fight fair don't boast just blank stares no joke
You want smoke then choke they gone hit you up (Yup)
Barrel in your mouth (Twelve gauge) they gone break you up
Spun around the block and you set me up
Nothing but run arounds where's my cut no rush
I'm Sarcastic full of static mask on (Mask on)
Asthmatic practitioner practicing parkour
Uno I had the last card I had to draw four (Uno)
That’s a fast card I had to play they ass hard (Haha)

Party people in the place, are you ready to go?
Get set, don't jet, but don't move slow

So get down to the sound and we can all have a ball
Gonna rock to the beat and have big fun

Rhyming from the top, it's the king of hip-hop
Call me Kool Moe Dee 'cause I just won't stop
And next on the list since you insist
Special K with the shot that just won't miss
And last on the line with the magical touch
Is LA Sunshine coming through in the clutch
And he's not down with The Three but he's part of the crew
His name is Easy Lee and this is what he's gonna do
Cut it up

All you knuckleheads that's been asleep
Wake up 'cause I got something that I want you to peep
And it's me, Moe Dee, in the flesh
I'm not frontin' on nothin', I'm always fresh
I'm rockin' in F on bass clef
Hip-hop to the rhythm 'cause I sound def
Hittin' every key from A to G
With a melody like do-re-mi
I dominate where other MC's fail
Syncopate the music scale
I can say a rhyme as ancient as old King Tut
Still make you boogie and shake your butt

Now I be rockin' to the rhythm of a funky beat
And using something that's known as a rhyme complete
'Cause I'm number one, known as numero uno
Rockin' to the rhythm 'cause I know you know
The place to be and the band to see
Is me when I start to MC
And when I greet the people I meet
Walkin' up and down the street
I just tell 'em (Uh) a-what it be about
'Cause it's the three MC's a-with all the clout
And when I'm on the stage the fly girl says, ""Watch""
The rhyme sayer, not the mayor like Ed Koch

'Cause it's the sound of the drum that makes you come
'Cause it's the sound of the drum that makes you come
It's the sound of the drum that makes you come
So c'mon party people, let's all get some
Lights, camera, roll 'em, LA Sunshine, action

[Verse 5]
Yo, grab a pen and write this down
And read it back to yourself and see how it sounds
It may sound like (Huh), that I'm just an MC
I'm not, I'm a prince of poetry
I don't sit down and write rhymes everyday
But people wanna sound like me anyway
So what I say, you better believe
Because what I've done, you'll wanna achieve
Call me an MC, but I'm claiming fame
Because you get a real chill when you hear my name
A chill that you get up and down your spine
Every time you hear me say ""LA Sunshine""

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the sound of the drum that makes you come
It's the sound of the drum that makes you come
It's the sound of the drum that makes you come

No matter how dark one's path may grow
Fate won't hurry, well, don't worry
We'll just keep our hearts aglow

[Chorus]
Love will find a way
Though skies now are gray
Love like ours can never be ruled
Cupid's not schooled that way
Dry each tear-dimmed eye
Clouds will soon roll by
Though fate may lead us astray
My dearie, mark what I say
Love will find a way

Writing verses to my lovers
Writing hooks for my groupies
So either way it goes I can always say I wrote this song for you
When your fucking other peoples minds, I hope you use a rubber
If you weren't such a sucker for love, you'd probably respect the demon on your shoulder more

Pre hook
And get high when you miss me
Drink when i don't call
Go out when your feed up
See me when you kiss her
Give that girl your all
But she won't know the difference

Hook
But you will, unfulfilled on a bitch full of lust
It could never be the same you and them, you and us
You can never fuck a human after you loved a god
You can never fuck a human after you loved a god
Verse 2
Now your gifted, you feel spirits
You know substance you can't deep dive all this surface
You want meaning, you want purpose
They don't do shit for you they don't deserve it

But you will unfulfilled on a bitch full of lust, it'll never be the same you and them you and us

I know you leaving them to wonder
Giving wrong digits to these groupies
So either way it goes, I can always say that to me you stayed true
When Im fucking other peoples minds, I gotta use a rubber

Call me when you miss me
You ain't gotta stall
Get high when I show up
Feel it when you kiss me
Give this girl your all
And you will feel the difference

I was focused on the prize
Never noticed all the lies, now it’s all gone
It’s funny if I had a new chance I’d probably play the same song
Still act like there never was a thing wrong
It’s okay, be okay, girl I’ll still let you have it your way
Wrote a whole tape ‘bout the things I’ll say
Before it all falls down
I guess I’ll throw it all away
Was it worth it

Water on me look like I've been glistening, look like I've been fishing, baby are you listening to me

I don't even know her birthday, what's her birthday?
Maybe one day she'll be here, just stay
How you told me that I'm thirsty? I ain't thirsty
No, I don't think it's alright to act this way
It's not okay at all
I'm a little shy, and I hope it's fine

Staring at my own face
Counting raindrops
Falling down
Longed for a deeper connection
That I did not know was in front of me
Your love caused a chain reaction
And now I'm breaking free
Even if you always knew
But didn't dare to set things in motion
What I want is here with you
To take a chance at love's devotion
Now I wanna fly into this open breeze
I must have been so blind
But you, you made me see
All my doubts, all my fears
They went up and disappeared
You have replaced them
With your heart
Now that I know your intentions

Bitch I'm boolin' in the bando
Hot comb on my roots
And marijuana stems on the floor

But every night I still feel alone

Bike rides through the park
No handlebars
Look what I can do
Electric bills too high
So after dark we light the candles
Mama don't you worry
We're gonna get back on our feet
Stay in bed and rest your head
And leave all else up to me

Touchin' on my thighs
I can tell that you really want me
But I barely know your name
So take your hands and get up off of me
My hair reaches for the sky
Don't give a damn if you can't see
But take a good look at it honey
'Cause you can't find this in a magazine
