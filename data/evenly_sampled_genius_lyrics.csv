I-I-I-
Up in California
Taking in the flora
Enjoying this ocean view
I never wanna leave here
I just want time to stop
And for the albums to drop

[Verse 1]

We walking down Hollywood boulevard
They tear our fucking heart apart
Our dreams and mistakes
Become our dreams, but fake
How they away with it
Cause this whole business
Is corrupt as shit
Our entertainment industries
Really must not be too pleased
Oh wait, they don't give a fuck
Turn the other way
So the creeps can get away
Maybe even give em a fucking raise
But when they eyebrows start to raise
We turn the other way

When everything is golden
Nobody will feel golden
Living like they gods
So we call em fucking odin
Boats were never rowing
Beats were always flowing
Homies found a place to be going
To find their passion
To follow their dreams
But you cannot dream, when your awake
Everybody just woke up
Models gonna throw up
Homie when you gonna grow up
I froze up
When I realized
That I've getting older
Used to be 7 years old
Now a 15 year old man
I only got one plan
Only got this one life
So I
Felt something was missing
So we started searching
The whole world started turning
My vision started blurring
By the time I came back
Everything was diffrent
Everything has changed man
So much shit was missing
So I went up on a mission
To re-fix the system
That we all call living
That clock just keeps on ticking

[Verse 1: Kyro]
Uh, yeah
Time is money, so I try to get the timing
The rap game sunny, peep the sky, its just so blinding
They think you funny when you try to be the one thats rhyming
Its sweet like honey, when I die its gon' taste like the Ramen
Ramen that I used to eat on Tuesdays, fuck what you make
Climbing up the ladder, this is Doomsday, where the crew stay
Signs of pitty patter from the crusade, thats a touché
Lines of ""whats the matter"" from my roommate, nothing to say
As I wake up from my dream, this shit ain't what it seems
A song to take up on thе screen, then you should've just seen
The look that brought up on thе scene, man it wasn't so keen
It shook him up, the certain thing that it wasn't so clean
He was writing lyrics just to make the people hear it
Despite the fearing, it was too fake, didn't put sincere in
And thats the clearance, he's not the one that was made for steering
I fight the spirit, plus I steer it, man I mean this dearest
[Hook: Kyro]
Uh, peep the motion
Ayo, just peep the motion
Peep the motion, go ahead and go and keep the motion

Peep the motion

Peep the motion, go ahead and go and keep the motion
Keep the motion (Yeah)
Ayo, just keep the motion
I know you scared but try to go ahead and keep the motion (Yeah)

[Verse 2: XLoRacer]
Pause for a second as I get another weapon to kill these adolescents
And thats just with my deadly presence
I take a gamble on life with a pair of dice for paradise
And since its not making cents, its really hard to pay the price
And then I figured out that there's no second chances
I skipped out on heaven to chill where the devil dances
To only see that that demons that were haunting me was self inflicted pain that was given' to me mentally
So I, started to smoke it away
Thought it was a clear escape and kept telling myself that ""it's okay""
But as these blunts keep getting rolled up
I keep getting shortness of breath and my words get choked up
I might as well not put myself through this abysmal hell
The only thing I want in life is to prevail
To tell my grandchildren all of my greatest tails
About this young hero who achieved his own holy grail
[Hook: XLoRacer]
Keep the motion, yeah, just keep the motion

That Bird,rap,Young Mugz,2016,46,{},"[Mugz]
Go head go head go head and jump
Just know there's no net at the bottom,this ain't a stunt
You get more than a bump tryna front on my progress
Im high but not too high to not see the devil in a blue dress
With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity
And I won't see defeat, victory is kicking up yo feet
Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street
I promote change but not the type to act strange
Change to better yourself and do better things

[Hook]
I fall but not too far down
Get up, i gotta swim or I'll drown
That bird wan sing, Mugz baby you're king
That bird wan ring, Mugz don't take the rope and hang
Yourself, too smart, safe guard your heart
Safe guard your heart
[Verse 2: Mugz]
I walked through fire and got burned, what did I learn
That every adult sins and it was just my turn
Ima firm believer in hit your head to keep it up
Cause you was looking down instead of looking up
Hard to see where you going with your eyes closed
You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

[Hook]
I fall but not too far down
Get up, i gotta swim or I'll drown
That bird wan sing, Mugz baby you're king
That bird wan ring, Mugz don't take the rope and hang
Yourself, too smart, safe guard your heart
Safe guard your heart
[Verse : Mugz]
If only I could fly, but no not I
I sing caged bird blues , drink booze, watch life pass me by
I got money but can't afford happiness what could I buy
Maybe a slice of pie or a piece of mind
Who am I, if I can't touch the Sky, a penguin
I taught I saw a putty cat inside brave men
Hoped ya peeped the quotes, they free but in the same boat
They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

[Poem]
The noose of life struggles will choke you
The hatred and envy of enemies will provoke you
But baby, remember what I told you
We gon be alright
When things go left, god will show you right
Ventilation will your revelation when you write
In dark he will be your light, in pitch black he will shine bright
We gon be alright",2940613,en,en,en
Keep It Real Remix,rap,Miilkbone,1995,844,{},"[Verse One]
I want crew's participation
In the strangulation of a nation
Concentrate and make fire stations die of smoke inhalation
A confrontation with more organization is complication
You better start looking for some new occupation
I slip the Reeboks on my feet and hit the street
You want beef, the top of your physique will hit the concrete
I rap like Iraq and bomb like Saddam
Rock a spot on your block that your clique's clocking on
A lot of little brains and names are flaming out the middle
So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole
I fill up coffins every so often
I wanna go to Heaven but Hell's closer and I hate walking
So M double I.L.K. will represent
The hip hop is hotter than sex inside a leather tent

I'm comfy cozy more Pussycats than Josie
White man on stepping on Ini Kamoze jumping rosey
40 below South Pole's and nine millis
On a cold corner looking silly like Chilly Willy puffing on Phillies
So breaker 1-9, break it down
I get rugged as a rapist in a naked ass town
Now set it off, breaking down doors, know we're knocking
Chop off your head and sent your neck shoulder shopping
And for beginner wanna tried to the winner
I'ma make Jeffery Dahlmer take your mama out to dinner
I turn your posse to a pretzel and make ends meet
You're good as a crossing guard on a dead end street
So fuck everybody who don't walk a hot block
With your Glock's cocked out to pop cops, knicky knock knock
We at the hip hop chop shop ready to stop crops from growing
I'm flowing, showing more stars than Rock N Jock

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now everybody knows I do more dirt than shovels
Psychotic skills leaving puddles
Of everything from muscles to knuckles
I claim pain, razor blade rain hitting your brain
And now we harder than sniffing frozen cocaine
You rapping robots are liars
I'll take the hot pliers out the fire
Stick 'em and pull out the wack wire
See the perception I be stressing is protection
I'm so bad I make girls vaginal section get erection
With perfection, you wanna race me than chase me
Your punk ass crews couldn't face me if ya maced me
So back up and let me move, I got a bloody point to prove
On a violent vibe and ready to groove
I'll do the dirty deeds and kill thirty thieves
Heard the others came back when your boys heard me leave
Now I read the law, break it down, either or
On the real, shining steal, keep it real, keep it raw

I remember the first time I had laid eyes
Black with the white stripe, the 1969 type
Late drives in the night time
White walls with them bright headlights, them headlights
Never have I ever wanted something so bad
I was ready to sell everything that I had
Just to sit in that car, dreams of driving really far
Driving out to see the sunset and the stars
And the stars always shine so bright
I never wanted to ever see the daylight
Driving coast to coast, love of my life to my right
Wind flowing just right, everything was alright, alright
But when that sun rise, everything was still right
That night I found the real love of my life
The white 2005 Camaro, Double blue stripe

Once have I ever wanted something more bad
I was ready to give you everything that I had
And all I had was my love, and you were like a drug
A couple henny shots, and I was already fucked
Up on your love, nicotine and weed could do no good
But then again who really could? Who could love like I would?
Never gave me the proper chance to really prove to you
I was watcha needed too, look at me, now look at you

Yeah
Nightingale is here
Listen...
Do you really believe in everything you see in Instagram? Oh, shit...
Yeah

[Verse One]
I’ma catch-potato, wanna know how I spend a day?
Surfing Instagram on my Apple phone - no way!
I think in this way I’m visualizing something
But the truth is that I’m simply doing nothing
Pretending being rich and wealthy, blowing flour but still healthy, always draped in something classy, behind the wheel of Maserati, hanging heavy Louie bags hella full with money bands, living in a penthouse which is higher than the clouds
Yeah
That’s my thoughts I’m lying and scrolling the feed
Yeah
I’ve never fought, but despite this I suffer defeat
Yeah
Rap game, for me it is still something new
No refrains in this track
But why, I got no clue
[Bridge]
This story is sad, cause Insta-dreams are fake
I’m getting hella mad, there are some actions to take

[Verse Two]
As an employee I’ve earned some funny money
Yeah
Never invested it, but felt like Axelrod Bobby
Spent a half on my Stans which are white and green
A couple of kickz is worth of fucking routine
My Instagram is opened on pages of business bloggers
Bentleys at the background , they all draped in suits and loafers
Double tap on their pictures the only thing that I do
Instead of building my life I flush the time down the tube
Yeah, ugh

People, please, don’t repeat my mistakes!

Yo! we win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts
We win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine
[Verse 2: R.H. Bless]
This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword
Hip-Hop's a holocaust, grab ya holy cross, ya crescent and star
Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah
Refer to ya bibles, Qu'ran and Torah

Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze
All those who choose to itemize lies

Phasers and lasers scopin, choking from smoke inhilation
Secret service agents are coming at me
I gotta hit em I sprayed, throw a grenade
Setting off the sprinkler system

[Verse 4: Poetic]
I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders

Rendezvous, special operations: team arsonists
Switch the disk and get out of there fast

Even though I'm type major
At times I might waver
Sweet as a life saver
But sharp as a knife razor
I engage the crowd when I'm dropping my style off
But you can't accuse till you walking a mile in my shoes
Stressful attempts to be successful
When haters for no reason detest you is the best fuel
One of the best few special vessels of the rest you

As I let my mind walk in the massive press thoughts
Traditional medicinal sentences, fresh quotes
And facts brought to back block against the trash talk
Blast off when my 10 toes touch the asphalt
Fast walk through the forest of flash floss and gloss
Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears
You gonna switch your gears and push till shit's clear yes sir

Verse One
(William Pippins)


What's a day from sycamore avenue?
Was babbling mumbling verbs I gotta prove
Like science fair’s on the day that’s due, Stupid kids
Was roaming these neighborhood’s funny we know
The outcome of crime guess God gave us a conscious too
So The only way to fly out the block was to be Lebron and
Pray to God that one day these new casters would come
They Casper see they didn’t show up we traded Spaulding for guns
And trapping keys like we stacking bricks on my mommas lawns
My Homie in the cell doing time like Rolex watch, The only things
That matters to him to watch the clocks, reminiscing on patience
Them day you didn’t know hatred, phone chirping from girls so when
You had they digits you made it, Pillow talks from this lil momma
She said was-sup? The Lust burning like the flames of the Hebrew
Boys in the furnace
Holy spirit speaking son yield, we was supposed to link at 5
I missed my ride that day her house got shot inside, God’s Will

Verse Two
(Demo Freeman)

I Never graduated from college
To earn a simple degree
I rather obtain my knowledge
From cook-in workin these streets
Man its obvious my fathers figure
Were nothin but drug dealers
With more bread than jiffy like its homemade cornbread
Momma said
Don’t you run mouth
Unless you run this house
I guess i'm running out
Packing my bags
Gather my cash
I’m ducking my stepdad
Because his tendencies
Is to close to my last dad
Got war in my heart
Life like its bagdad
Lord knows my empty soul is captivated by things that keep me enslaved
To wanting to be So famous
But little do i know
That my soul was jus on the ropes
And i'm fighting to keep it close
Cuz these demons want me to fold
My heart is growing so cold
Look down
Pick up my phone
A message coming from God, its ringing i pray i answer and won't deny",4025987,en,en,en

And I like when she get mad
She looking sexy all annoyed

Put them diamonds on my wrist

They know we ain't no scrubs
If we beefing say my name
Cause I ain't dissing on a sub
Came from nothing
Then I went and got that shit right out the mud
Blew a stack on these Versaces
Just to step on Gucci rugs

This was my position

So I had to stop slippin
I had to make a choice
To get it or accept
So much poison in the air
I ain't wanna take a breath
And at times I would be scared
But I never chose death
In a game with no ref
I played the cards I was dealt
I had to play the field
Get it how I live
I could never keep a friend
I ain't even have a cent
But I had to to use my wits
Had to use my common sense
And with everyone I met
I though what they want outta this

To say goodbye
To the fake me

Say whatever you want
I want care
I don't need haters
Just some new fresh air
I am me
You be you
Not the fake one
The one thats been due
Verse 2:
Why you tryna say you're strong and tough
Thats just gonna get your life rough
Why you tryna say your the best baller
Some people have to work hard like getting a sholar
Why you tryna say you have depression
To say that, its kinda a question
Why you tryna say you were bullied
Some people actually did and they still need a sheild

Being devoured by psychological gout
Gotta pack up my past, keep it deep in the ground
While I move forward trying to find my sound
I'm a poet with a melody, reiterate c'est la vie
Helping others through with songs as remedies
Keeping it simple, six strings and voice
Going on, it's as if that I had any other choice
Splitting my hand, blood on my guitar
If I add the sweat and tears someday I'll be a star
I dream to have my name in lights, people cheering my name
I'll be struck by the sheer anecdote again and again
I know that one day I'll be paid just to pick up a pen
And when I'm there I know I'll stay true to my friends
I'm thankful for the support that always helped me through

Yeah!
This right here’s for all my niggas!
This right here’s for---
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I hear them in the crowd, shouting out ""let them speak""
Before the bullets fly, I'm arriving at my peace
And it's there for a second. Gone in a blink
So I don't need a ride I'll drive myself to the brink
Dearly departed. Dearly departed
I hope you're happy now
Look what you started

I don't know what's out there
But it's slow for down here
Won't need a ride where I'm going

Pick up the pace cause damn I am bored

I got taxes building up at my doorstep
I got police tryna knock my door in
I got guns and I got grenades
I got tanks and I got Beyblades
I got fidget spinners and they iridescent
Though they’re outta style so I’m tryna sell ‘em
I got illegal drugs at my disposal
I got diamond rings for a proposal
I got girls that I gotta marry
I got a rap game I gotta carry
I got a featured artist on my track
Spittin’ nothing but fire back to back

So many things, so many things, so many things
(O, you have to say something, you can't just sit th-)

So many things I can tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know really
How to tell you cuz the possibility
That you look at me with a different energy

Drugs
Ever since the first moment I stroked your flame
From then on, I knew
That by you being in my life
Things were destined to change cuz
Drugs
So many people use their pain in vain

Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Drugs
Through all the ups and downs, the joys and hurts
Drugs
For better or worst
I still will choose you first

Violins score the violence
Cross country miles piling

Talking bout don't hurt me that a pain if you so rich pull up in A range

Diamonds be glistening when I teach you,  you
Not listening i be cooking in the kitchen
Don't hate on me cuz the money start sprinkling
Half of these people need discipline
When I'm coming from the plane I be flipping
Flying high like kite

Last Time,rap,Kill The Vultures,2015,67,{},"[Verse 1]
I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar
Stuck with ugly faces, scarred
Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands
[Chorus]
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
I won't come round here again until the flask's dry

[Verse 2]
It’s time to take the stand, raise your hand
Try to beat the case again
Why'd you shake the branch deeply rooted in forsaken land
It's not your place to operate on patience you keep locked away
Not today, yesterday, tomorrow
What you got to say?
No excuse, searching for words that never come
Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind",2900034,en,en,en
White barz,rap,Peter Sorensen,2013,23,{},"Man, I'm sick of all these people saying 'you have to be black to rap'
Even though half the blaack people that rap's bars are wack...
They have no meaning apart from 'their high use of drugs'
Or hustling like thugs when their all just a group of black mugs...
I'm sick because I'm white and my bars have a lot of meaning
That's because my barz come from the streets and now from what I'm dreaming...
Alls you hear about these days is, 'imma hit this shit so hard'
Tbh you should be talking about how drugs are bad so show them the red card...
Also in every rap I ever here they always use the word nigga at least 3 times
Even when teens are spitting barz in the lunch line its all grime...
But grime isn't good it just sounds meaningless and too rough
It doesn't make you sound good and to be honest its not tough...
Your making rap look like its gone downhill since pac died
And if he was still alive if he could hear your rap he would of commited suicide...
See when I rap I talk about my life and how I changed from a young age
And not how 'I waz gonna go get high and pissed coz its ma birthday'...
So next time you spit some barz make them a bit better and less shit
And I might not have something to complain at and get a pen to write it...",162052,en,en,en

[Verse 1: Lil Memer]
Taking no one's input but your own
Your confidence high, but you’re making mine low
I'm talking, but you ain't listening (Hello?)
Never saw you with a smile
Won’t be back home in a while or ever
You know you coulda been better
But so could have I
You don't see me depressed with these dismal eyes
Why?
I just don't think it's a matter of time
Am I getting a call to come and die? (Come and die)
I'm broken
I think I might (might, might commit suicide)
I'm broken, can you fix me?
Listening to this again might be the end of me
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
Singing this again might be the enemy
Singing this again might be the enemy
What if I am the enemy?
What if I am the enemy?

We're not okay but we choose to be in the end

Nickel, nickel
Dime by dime

Whole gang Moncler uniform when we cold out
Can't let 'em know the play, everything we say gotta be in code now
Die before I'll slow down

Used to be scared, that card going through for sure now

Caught that little shawty right outside of my window
Got the kinda ass to make a nigga pop a endo
If i let her in then she gotta bring her friends through
Cause if Nizzy winning then his niggas gonna win too
Money over everything thats my fucking mantel
Had to make em hear me, so i  killed this instrumental

...see you back my dawg
I just pray they take the shackles off
Need my people from behind the wall
I don't even wanna answer call

[Verse 1]
This some heartfelt shit, catch a hot slug
We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly
I can't go back to the snow
No boots on my feet, wit' my sneaks full of holes
Mama did her best, but she did it on her own
When I had nothing left, still got it like I'm grown

I don't wanna see you back my dawg
I need my people from behind the walls
I don't even wanna answer calls
It breaks my heart 'cause I know what you lost
I don't wanna see you back my dawg

I don't even wanna answer calls
It breaks my heart 'cause I know what you lost

[Verse 2]
You got something to lose don't let 'em take it
Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces
Couple niggas doing life, growing ancient
I just wanna better the gang, let's get a spaceship
Roney still clean the block up, call me maintenance
Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican
Get my youngin drop a package off
Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved
'Cause my dawg behind the wall playing basketball
Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot
Roney like the sun, he can heat the block
We don't need to stop
We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot
Need my dawg from behind the wall
He locked up playing basketball

I don't wanna see you back my dawg
I need my people from behind the walls
I don't even wanna answer calls

Multiply my bands, while they smoke up all the grams
Second album in, tryna stack up my ends
This a me to an end, I ain't tryna be friends
Cause everything good truly comes to an end
Talking life, relationships, and now I'm rhyming my plight
Sit in dark room, late-night, scared of the flight
Cause I don't want this shit to end, I'ma slave for my life
Sometimes, I wonder what we on, what's beyond this?
I'm scared to diе, and homie, I'm just being honest
Only twеnty-two, so tell me what you want to do

Living vicious all night
Gang signs, hang time
Jump me, in it for life
Throw me on that corner, get me stabbed, it's alright
Feel like nobody love me, and my heart get cold at night
For the devil creeping on me, I ain't looking for the light
I ain't shit to these kids
I ain't shit to this bitch
They just look at me like dollars, give a fuck if I'm dead
It's just on to the next one, and fuck what he said
Even if I give a arm and leg

White progressive philantrophic extortion of our condition
We ignore it 'til we wanted an apartment for us to live in
And is rented by a liberal proponent of capitalism
Who believes that the God's gift to Black and Brown people
Then appropriate the culture, of which they are a vulture
Caught the rollers on the lady with her baby in the stroller
Who was raised where they just moved to from in the zone
It's the old neighborhood with the whiter population
Under the codenames, ""Up and coming, revitalization""
Collective, urban, it's even more disturbin'
When the transplant treats the native family with discernment

Stigmatized the ghetto 'cause it's full of liquor stores and blunt rappers

Are with the thought of legal weed and hipster rap attract laughter
Sometimes, I feel like I'm hatin' for no reason at all

Or no Latinos at all, or Filipinos at all

Hi Mrs. Lynch, this is Mrs. Zubrod. I'm calling from Deerfield Elementary about your son, Jason. Um, I've been having a few concerns just about his ability to focus in class. There are some options that I've briefly discussed. Um, we see this a lot with children and it might be some form of ADD. I'm not a doctor so I would suggest that maybe-
Uh, Mrs. Lynch, this is Mr. Bailey, Jason's fifth-grade teacher. I'm calling 'cause I'm very concerned about your son. It seems very possible that he will not pass the fifth grade. He's been failing very regularly-
Mrs. Lynch, this is Principal Reynolds, calling again for the third time. Please give us a call back as soon as you can. Jason has been suspended from school yet again for getting into a fight. Um, he's becoming a real problem for the kids. It seems he's getting into an altercation every other day. Um, we've tried to reach out, we're trying to help him. But there's only so much I can do. Mrs. Lynch, we have no choice but to suspend your son immediately-
This is Detective Pearson with the Third District Police Department. We are searching for Jason Mills; he's been implicated in a armed robbery case. We have a good bit of evidence that Jason is involved. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible. It's nothing to worry about, hope I hear from you soon-
Hi, this is Stacey from State Farm. The total for this case will be 7,550 dollars. Please give me a call back and let me know how you'd like to process the payment-
You have ten minutes remaining on this call

With limited brains
Tryna mimic for fame

That you’re a buffoon
Take trash like raccoons

Take the pen

This as perfect

Fire off a diss

Snakes are gna hiss
They so revolting
They soul is open
And ima close it

On Green Im Hulking
Wannabes i corrupt
Ive barely spoken
Scary and they jump
Cuz I've awoken

Shaken and choking
Give rhymes in bulking

And now they hoping
That theres a cure
For this pathogen
Disease so pure
Have to cope and
They're unsure
Doctors they phoning

I will handle petty disrespect
I will dismantle everything  you say

Come against me itll be fourth down you runts go punt to the field and track

I'm that clean nigga with the pink apparel
And I'm self taught, still on the level
And my whip clean, moved from the pedal
Get me so hype, see my blood vessel
I'ma soul fighter, let me Hakusho
Yu Yu, how to do you
Fuck a rule-book, I'm my own cool
I got 2 looks just a different mirror
Used to hate me, now I'm lookin' clearer
I don't follow up cuz I am the leader
Gotta work hard so fuck a reefer

Can't accept this, it's all for lust

​But my success was written before my birth
​I excel from the energy I exert
​The world cracked open when I dropped the merch
​Zombies crawlin' out of the ground clawin' the earth

​Went out to Rome, spent a weekend in Greece
​Poured liquor in a glass and rolled weed in a leaf
​Momma cried out to Jesus, ""Lord keep him in peace!""
​They stay marginalizing Yeezus and they sleepin' on me

​I keep it raw with a sexy persona
​I play my role like a professional roller
​To move around, I do golds on the front and root canals on all the rest of my molars, Petie

​I told my Momma that I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best

​They comin' for my head, they comin' for my head
​But momma I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best

​I try not to blame 'em cos they weren't raised how I was raised
​They was sneak dissin' for years so I ain't phased
​Cos i got the title belt and a head full of tidal waves
​Not to mention the ladies that I done slayed
​Layin' the younger hoes and I'm lyin' about my age
​and niggas hatin', but real recognise...
​well you know the rest of the sayin', we ain't related

​and the power of my penmanship can't be debated
​plus money's comin' in nowadays
​I'm elated, the car note was due yesterday and I can pay it

​It's the simple things that make me happy
​the girls that call me papi, my babies that call me daddy
​the fans that listen and help me like a taxi
​she got her hair straightened and came and gave me the nappy
​everybody rap but not everybody is savvy
​so i can understand why my success make you aggy

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, she was seventeen years old, life was good
Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
No one laughs when it happens to someone you know
Happens every single day in the World that we live in (yeah)
It never turns out how you thought it would, did it? (nope)
[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Brought up in insolent conditions
In a position, outside the lines that fit in

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Yeah, he was seven years old and came from nothin (yeah)
Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
Doesn't matter what we come from, we just don't know
Where our life's gonna go in this World that we live in
It never turns out how you thought it would, did it?
[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Classified - talking over Chorus]
Never turns out how you thought it would, did it?

You may have heard a lot about Rap Genius lately
But I suppose you have been looking at it rather sedately
Just another boring lyric site, nah, don't be fooled
Rap Genius ain't just a site where you get lyric-schooled
It's a collaborative annotation platform where you can explain anything
From lyrics to the Bible, we annotate everything
From TV shows to sports to the latest in games
To GRANDMA'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...
Nah, we ain't ashamed!
So how do they get, so many annotations without paying people?
It's quite clever actually
And if you write fluently, concise, and factually
You'll eventually find yourself part of the editors faculty
Where you can be free of the white hat normality

[Verse 2: Ryan Vice]
Ayo, we branched out to all different divisions
It's not just rap, we got poetry, rock and news
Plus a whole bunch of other crap
And being a great editor, with all you contribute
Can eventually earn you the moderator attribute
And then you will be able to reign over others
Gain some power, recognise talent where it is due
Oh what... I forgot about IQ!
IQ can be a motivator for many
Writing good annotations can get you plenty
But IQ whoring?
That's a definite penalty
[Verse 3: Ryan Vice]
Ugh, one more and I'm signing out

But all this great stuff aside, you wanna know the real reason
I stay allied, to the RG fam, representin' worldwide
It's the staff yo! Their friendly in nature
Mahbod, Shawn, Tom, Jeremy, Illan, Tobias, they always stay ill 'n
They got the mastermind persona
To keep the site running
And the Tech guys are great, making sure we stay update
To the annotation platform, that has improved my love for writing
Austin, Gavin, Tomi, you guys always stay trill
And Verified Artists? Most genius thing ever
This is a great leap for man, one of raps hugest endeavors
Which works quite a charm
Getting primary perspectives
On a line that may create an interpretation dilemma
Being able to connect with rappers themselves
Establishing a deeper connection between fans and artists is great for the health!

If you going through this
This for you
Just think about it real deep

[Chorus: Astrid Nora]
When we were together
Never thought two'd become three
So, now what? Is it over?
This I can't believe

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion [?]
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment
[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

Light prayers I don't trip over flight stairs
On the quest to be the Master Sword's master

Pack my items like book bags in high schools

From Underwater to the thrones of King Zora
I'm trying to save the day, but I'm so out of order

To rescue the Princess but I come up empty

Pass the lava pits, crushed the same Goombas

But if I see another little midget from Toadstool
Tell me the Princess is in another Castle
I'm gonna leave 'em to be snack food for Bowser
But I'm not given up, my boldness is risen up
And this girl that I love won't be a prisoner
Another day, so I dash Pipes to World 8
Fantasying we're holding hands through some peril gates
I reached the Castle, feeling like its the final hour
Here come Bowser, I grab a Flower for Fire Power
I knocked him in the lava, and got the Princess home
Then got stuck in Minus World, Negative Zone

And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""
And I said
I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no I'm not your average nigga

(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
Other honey you was kickin' it to)

[Verse 2: Jeru the Damaja]
I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm gone I thought that I would teach her
(Where'd you meet her at, black?)
At The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said ""Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said ""Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect""
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo
I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know I'm not your average nigga

(scratch-""Chain nigga""-scratch-""here you comin' but your steps are to loud
Standing on the corner, thought him was cool""-scratch-""chain nigga"")

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes
(God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
I said ""Don't worry about it
Put that shit on the side, and slide up in the crib""
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said ""Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'""
She said ""Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window""
I said ""Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy""
She said ""You never, know where he may be""
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said
I said
Yo I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

Mista, I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga

When I be back
Get stronger mentally, physically, hold my ability get in my zone never show hostility keep to myself keep on showing positivity

I care too much about others and not on myself
Little did I know I was slowly breaking myself
This shit wasn't good at all for my health
Stuck in the chapter that seem to never end
Wish I could travel to Netherland
Not worry about anything in another land I recommend

But life isn't a fairy tale life ain't fair as you can tell
It doesn't want to see you succeed it just wants to see you fail
But fuck that shit I rebel wanna work my way up from nothing to something and never stop until I get to the top and be able to have my own story to tell

Not going to fall in line
Fall in what everyone does
Want to have a free mind
And do what I does create my own story without any worry I made my own choice I did it so that I can grow but my girl said that is some Bullshit well I think that you should just probably go
Not everything revolves around you
Gotta do shit for myself
I really did love you but I guess now I gotta focus more on me myself

I'm on a mission I'm a young man with a lot of ambition
I miss my family I truly do miss them but when I get back they really Be able to see my transition from a little boy to a young man
Understand I was too afraid to raise my hand but here I am a young Man with a plan and this is my place this is where I stand

Things change
Friends change
If you really think things can stay the same then you're probably insane
Go to learn how to adjust to the shit
Flip the page start on a new script
Forget about the past live in the now there's no better feeling than being on the mound

Living in the moment doing what I know what to do focus on my girl feeling like the one never two I hope you understand that too

Life going fast like a fastball throwing junk like a curve ball never could fall always gotta stand tall give it my all not like a nub never make a bad call

I'm not selfish I just wanna make my choice
Sending a message so I'm using my voice
All smiles and no tears it was just all a bit
Think you know me but you don't know me at all one bit

Traveling up and down an escalade
Forbade and then locked in a cage
One thing that we will never do is Fade

It gets harder and harder to make a wage
The situation that surround us are getting lame
Life doesn't last any longer by having Fame
In another chapter which turns another page
Getting played and sent on a wild goose chase
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Will there be a day in the shade?
Is there a way when we got to find a way to make pay?
Would work still be waiting for you when you awake?
To come back to the home that is laid to find that the floors had been paved
No matter what is placed on the plate
One thing that we will never do is Fade
Could it be right because we all make mistakes?
It is difficult to keep it real with the fake
Maybe laws should be tried again at a later date
With plenty of space to move away but have to stay
Where one can be in the same place but in a different State
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Handed a short end of the stick to slice the cake
Not a hand to aide in the crack between the quake
False representing evil ways by appearing saved
Out of all of the money made there is a breach in the safe
It doesn't matter what someone has at stake

Telling everyone that it is what it is when it ain't
Having to be talked to while they rave a rant all Day

Verse One

I stopped writing rhymes on paper a long time ago
Cos that cannot be copy and pasted into the liner notes
And now I hardly use my MPC
Because I find it too restrictive when I’m making these beats
But yo’ I still use a valve mic
Because my vocals record clear
And people tell me that is what it sounds like
I got a PC and a Mac
So I can choose between Cubase and Logic when I build a track
The way I work is more flexible and the library of sounds available
And accessible’s tremendous, I still release music independent
The running time of my catalogue is endless
I’m more meticulous listening to audio
To make better music for the people who support me yo’
So for the fans who reach out with the messages
The Africans, Asians, English and Americans
My people in Europe, Australia, Canadians
I hope the music I make will bring some radiance into your life
Could be the words that I’m saying
Or the beats that are playing that can keep you maintaining
Hah’, so let me end this on a dope note
Something you can tell to all your people’s as a dope quote
You may have heard it before, but yo’ it’s mad sick

A very sad situation that's unfortunately how life happens in reality your gonna know oh so very very well

Verse 1:
Yo what up with all these buster lame deer
Who just can’t hang or bang
Let alone be a brother from another mother playing it cool with poise like
True R&P emcee trailblazers that’s down by law to honorable
Hip hop
Causes prepared for whatever life throws at him
Generating interest
Not being boring likе some lame-o’s cause I’m spitting rhymеs for the unlucky kids
Without a dad or mom that got cheated in life blessing them reciting this psalm prayer
Hopefully to be answered as providence eventually so sucker lame deer playing adulting games
See the error in there ways that could never afford
To help
One another or be honest let alone fathom to understand why is that imagining
What it’s like to be younger again getting shafted caught in a dead end job
Life happens being stuck in the rat races maze thats why sinderella manns
Staying truest in this krush groove funkyfresh
Never stale
Just new photosynthesized oxygen every little step
I take by myself
On this lone road not you Bobby brown to move people untraceably with power musics
Meaning that lame deer benignly neglect sinderella mann
For filthy rat emcees
Polluted corny cliched hogwash crap copycunts can duplicate but fail to bite or replicate
This multi spectrual flow let alone figure out what
Makes sinderella mann tick
Trying to mock his highnesses hotshot heroine overdose mind boggling
Keep it gangster with ya flair your trying to diss but don’t even know the half

Ops ops ops ops

Verse 2:
Whose living the coolest baller tipping for life thats got it made in the shade
Is what matters most fuck your opinion outside that conclusion
Without
Bullshit popularity contests dammit from east coast to west coast
Keep the crossover
Sinderella manns gonna stay frosty like a snowman using this funk while
Many act as if they enjoy being conventionally boring in some square trendy
Predictable life cycling manner sinderella mann
Won’t ever understand
Others lame deer games who shall remain nameless
Because your soo vain
You couldn’t keep the mic hot and you probably think this song is about you dont you dont you
Lacking Rockwell’s voice and rick James’s guitar skills
Cause you never had
The option or choice sinderella mann does barking preternatural powers in the dark
Rocking rhymes ripping the mic all indolent imbeciles can't relate to
With disgust in your eyes
Being another brick in the wall pussyfooter that doesn’t have shit on true loc’ed out
Hip hop gangsters like sinderella mann dropping refillable scripts to blow
Your fucking brains out with funky grammar as a certified jammer living to win
Down to expose any flaker for the fraud you are through

Thats strong enough to visualize celestial astrology
Coming to life
Thats very real unless your left behind saying

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many

Judges Criteria,rap,Arobie1992,2014,82,"{SR_thePangloss,HashSlingingSlasher,MrXercules,Afarese}","SR_thePangloss:

Just for reference, and I may re-post this as I see fit, here is my rough criteria for judging. Obviously, since this is text based, it’s much easier to disregard rhetorical flourishes, so don’t expect to get points for claims you don’t back up. Anyways:Demonstrates an intricate understanding of how (not necessarily to what extent..) their album impacted Hip Hop culture.Differentiates between cultural implications of Hip Hop as a sociopolitical platform, and Rap (i.e. rhyming words over a beat to create multi-rhythmic patterns) as an art form.Clearly states their main points of argument, and continually refers back to them in order to clarify their reasoning.Supports their main points with some sort of verifiable evidence, observable on a wide-scale. Anecdotes can be insightful, but they have no place supporting an argument for or against.Demonstrates basic critical thinking skills.Novel arguments or reasoning, which aren’t widely seen in any one of the thousands of This album vs. That album threads scattered across this forum already. Seriously, I don’t want to read arguments I’ve heard a hundred times, especially if you can’t offer up any sort of new information to support these arguments.Otherwise, this debate really has almost nothing to do with which album is actually “better”, so don’t expect to get an easy win just because you lucked out with a critically/commercially claimed album. Along those same lines, I’m expecting even more from you if you do have a favorable match up

Arobie1992:

Pretty much everything SR covered looks good. Here's some stuff I specifically wanted to address for my judging criteria:The argument being made is more important than the format of the entry, though I am somewhat partial to essays.If the entry is in essay format, I'm looking for good usage of grammar and writing. It doesn't have to be perfect, but there shouldn't be simple typos (e.g. apart vs. a part, alot instead of a lot, etc.). Follow the rules here and you'll be good.Arguments should aim for objectivity. Entirely subjective reasoning will only serve to hurt your argument.I highly recommend using outside sources, which should be referred to.Able to relate different aspects to each other (e.g. social impact to commercial success).Demonstrate an understanding of each of the aspects you discuss beyond a basic level. So for example, if you talk about lyrical quality, discuss why the lyrics are better than your opponent's album's lyrics.Length is irrelevant. The submission should be as long as you feel it needs to be to cover everything you want to discuss in adequate depth, but no longer.Again, the goal of this is not whose album is better, but who can provide the more well-reasoned, compelling argument for why their album is better/more important/whatever. As SR said, just because you have what you, or even many, may consider to be a superior album, don't expect to be able to slack. If it's famous, it's famous for a reason, and we're going to expect you to know, understand, and articulate those reasons clearly and concisely

MrXercules:

To be added

HashSlingingSlasher:

Here are some of the things I am looking for:Good, solid evidence. Don't just include your opinions, even if you can back those opinions up. You should also give some statistics, expert opinions, etc. Something that is actually hard, solid evidence, and not just subjectiveClarity of ideas. Make sure that you explain yourself thoroughly. Remember, this can be as long as you like, so don't be afraid to be wordy. Make sure that you ideas are well thought out and easy to understand. If you can't explain an idea well, or can't support it enough, then that is probably a sign that the idea isn't really good enough to be included. A thesis statement might be a good idea hereI'm a bit of a grammar nazi. You don't have to be 100% right 100% of the time, but at least make it evident that you really attempted to have correct grammar and spelling. Remember, spellcheck is your friend, and if you really aren't good with grammar, then you could always have someone else read your writing to make sure it is correctFocus on all aspects of your album. Not just the lyricism, or the flow. Get into the producing as well. Make sure you know your album like you know the back of your hand. Discuss every part of it that you think proves it's greatnessJust like in any debate, don't leave any ""chinks in your armor"", so to speak. If your album has a weak point, don't just try to ignore it, or your opponent (and myself) will notice. Don't try to sweep things under the rug. If you are leaving holes in your defense, they will be found and exploited

And most of all...Proofread! Seriously, this is one of my pet peeves. After you are ""done"", read through your essay a few times. Any grammatical errors? Any spelling errors? Any ideas that don't seem well thought out or that seem skimpy? Keep reading through it until you don't find anything that you want to changeAfarese:

Basically everything the other judges said will apply for me as well, but here are the things I will most be looking at:Good grammar. It doesn't have to look like an English scholar wrote it, but it should have few mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Mixing up ""there"" with ""they're"" or ""to"" and ""too"" should be avoidedDemonstrates a good amount of knowledge on how the album impacted hip-hopThe argument should not be subjective and state just opinions, the argument should be objective and state factsUses outside information, such as commercial performance, critical reception, or professional reviews. Not mandatory but highly recommendedDemonstrates that the album was listened to and analyzed, and argument well thought out rather than just being thrown togetherAlso, as stated before this is not about who's album is better. An argument could be a great album vs a terrible album, but if the terrible album's argument is explained better then it will win. The more well thought out argument that shows that you listened to the album and analyzed it well",359136,en,en,en
From the Machine,rap,Van Roy Asylum,2020,11,{},"Between my life and death

They go in a simmilar way
Hordes of useless lives
Were dropped and forced to pay

To figure out my gift is this desire

Butt into system
And fill your heart with hope
While others choose to leave that
They ease the pain with fall

Hey, kid. Do you wanna play a game?
The bet is simple
Just your desire to live
The rules are incredibly simple
You have to pass through all this existence shit
Please don't complain about
Any problems that you face with

Creeping death is a masterpiece

I turned on my tv and started my overflow
Covered in the Blood of Christ, from head to toe
Hedge of protection, top, bottom, midsection
Angelic forces, ain’t no more discourses
Marriage made in heaven
Won’t be no divorces
They said it’s 50/50
But I only go 100
Times infinity
But you really can’t count it
Trophy on my desk
But I’m really tryna mount it
God gave me a test
And I’m not tryna flunk it
I’m swinging for the fences
And I’m not tryna bunt it
Got a homerun
When they said, “Go home son”
Well I went home
And bought the neighborhood for fun
They like “who dat?”
Well I’m not J. Cole
But I’m Suave Sterling

I give you fresh raps

Paint a perfect picture
Paint a perfect picture of a man that’s not perfect
Though he’s not perfect, man this man is not useless
They made a Muriel but you can’t call it a Eustace
What’s a man?
A man is just a man
Until you throw the sauce on him, just like a personal pan
I give delivery
They always wanna give me tips
Wasn’t with me in the gym
But wanna see me do a flip

You just only know my start
You look at what I’ve done
Not at what I do
Turn the mirror over
Begin to look at you
Before you cast a stone
What’s inside them bones?
Before you throw a stick
Think about it quick
You didn’t know my Savior
So you won’t know me

I hustle to the next
I don’t like to argue

You never really went outside (no)

As a queen you divine
Go to space in your mind, cuz you thinking all the time
And nowadays I’m not that sure that you be thinkin’ at all
Cuz every time you look up in the mirror see something wrong
That reflection ain’t impressive to ya, need somethin’ strong
Hey watchu thinking bout yourself, you couldn’t be more than wrong
Damn, that’s why I’m droppin’ this song
Cuz every time we talk, you so good at just nodding a long
And in a minute throw my wisdom out the back of the car
Along wit everything your momma says, you back around one
I know you thinking that I’m crazy as protective as fuck
And I ain’t need to worry bout ya, cuz you good on your own
But I can’t shake the vision of this shit go terribly wrong
I see that shit in 20/20, and you playing along
But a 30 is no game, when you take it its no gain
Yeah it feel like there no pain, for a minute but then witness
As the feeling just fades off, and the days just seem long
You seen the victims of it, yeah its harder to ween off
And two fingers ain’t no solution, you tryna clean off
A facade that ain’t really there, its yourself you can’t really bear
But you pulling your shit together, you go inpatient for real
I knew you had it up in you, I knew that thought would prevail
And I called you, thought it was jail, and you wanted to go home
And the spot depressin’ as fuck, and the feeling is so alone
I called you and then I cried, cuz you really mean so much
To the realest of all friends, who be with you till the end
These snakes, they try to use you, they plotting cuz they be serpents
They hurt you, but they be losing, cuz you the one that be worth it
Yeah, I said you the one that be worth it, you not the one to be hurting
You not the one to be hurting, no
We took the long way home
Just talk about everything
Hop up off that train, you were looking scary
Told you open up, told you that you do mean everything
Pull up on a backstreet let the tears fall
You feel you got nobody, you in that free fall
If you ain’t got no body you still got me, dog
Said you got nobody, you still got me but you
Gotta get back, bounce back like Sean don
What’s whack, be Ramadon, when you sad, the long con
Stand up on your own two, breathe in when its O2
You saying you can’t do, but I really do know you
I could write up a hunnet songs, and keep workin in pro tools
Keep telling you old news, been trying to show you
But you good at nodding along, been facadin’ for so long
Its you who gotta do different, already I see a difference yeah
I hate to see you burn, I hate when you be off again
I hate when you don’t learn, I hate when they go out without ya
But wait cuz its your turn, you’ll make it you’ll be laughing at
The snakes who hid inside the grass, your patience and your pride will last
I say this, shit I say it all, I really care, you really are

I produced this one myself too
You'd probably guess that but I just wanted to fit the theme you know

[Chorus]
Ay
So invested in the book fair I'd die for a book
If a book got rejected I would cry for a book
If a book was a hitman I'd drive by for a book
Above all pointer fingers, put my life for the books

[Verse 1]
At this point, I truly hate the rich girl
She told on me for dropping an eraser. What a snitch girl
The rich boy just got expelled
But I don't really care and I don't wish them well
Cause he bought all the Minecraft books Scholastic had in stock
And his dad bought all the toys that I ever could've bought
It's the new Scholastic Book Fair and there's chaos where it's at
So once you finish checking out you better run and watch your back
Still going to the book fair and I'm tired of trying
It's like Dababy on baby except it's fighting on fighting
Cause there's young crazies with rabies outside trying and trying
To take all of your items after you just finish buying
[Intermission]
Also, for the record, I know Scholastic is spelled wrong. So, if you guys could just stop messaging me about i-

[Chorus]
Ay the Scholastic Book Fairs climbing
But it's coming back not quiet
It's a nightmare when elementary kids learn about violence
In the middle school
Think they're a little cool when they're despicable
They'll steal your nostalgia and trade it for a little ridicule

[Verse 2]
A little kid came up; was like age 9
Was reading records from Guinness; was like page 9
He said, ""Can I have a look?"" so I handed over the book
Until he ran off with what he took
The ripped Vans of a smuggy crook
I chased the kid to the door of his mother's car
Cause I was just about to finish the page with Tony Hawk
Ran close then I got him
He dropped it. I caught it
Worth it even though I think my ribs just got kicked in

If a book was a hitman I'd drive by for a book

Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back

Still sensing the animosity

Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)

Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio

Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon

And they ain't got a job, I wanna bloom a cook
Took 'em long enough, told 'em I wanted a ""vroom""
But all they wanted to do was listen to MF Doom
I mean, they just too lazy
I mean, they just too crazy
I mean, where's the daisy?

I ain't need no character, better not mess my terrace up
Error and terror, man you bastards better watch out
Sharer and bearer, bad news, channel cruise
Better not be a beggar, ever
Look in the mirror so everything just gets a little bit clearer
Never quittin', this shit stellar, no condition
Always clever, this my era, send ya a letter
It ain't even my native language, but my English better than yours
In this state of anguish, better get her with the roars
All this shit I manage to keep up
And I just never give up
My vantage, with a sandwich, y'all should vanish
Languish, they ain't even here

And balloons the houses no ceiling
Just dedication, syrup and soda
The third times the charm for the drive to be over
Bought it too deep, detox

Never pop, sunshine eternal
Mind, spotless and rainbow paper trust studio pain
They be putting in work with the computer okay
Ayy kid I don't give a flying fuck what you say
I'm still the man on the moon at the end of the day
Cause I'm a college dropout that's always late to register
Finna get to graduate for like a working 8 to 8
Floors getting twisted and start to fantasize
Yellow brick road[?]

So I fuck her real quick, I was in and out
Then we went dine out in In n' Out
I ask her now, questioned her why she doubt
What that shit be all about
I ask her now, questioned her in what she know
Why she never wanna show
So I fuck her while I play Pokemon Go
She got emotions so they never show

Alright

I saw this post by Karat Kev saying ""Think about your impact
What do you do for your community, do you give back?""
Anyone can kick phat slick raps
Bunch of fuckin pissants talking bout they shivs dacked, that shit's wack
I ain't ever flipped packs, I just try to kick facts
Motherfuckers break under pressure just like a Kit-Kat
Saw your little track and I just skipped that
Motherfuckers stupid and I bet they never fuckin heard a Nip track
That's real talk
It's like it isn't 'bout the art no more
It's all about your designer clothes and the cars you got
Intelligence isn't respected no more and it makes me sick
But I'm thе artist that they was asking for
But just be hard and raw, that's that normal shit
What is normal shit? I guess it's fuckin talking shit
Going on Instagram, posting a bit of corny shit
Start a beef with somеone, go back and forth for the audience, performing it
When one you lose, the'll applaud the shit
Remember when it's all said and done, no one talkin it like Jordan is
And imma never fuckin call it quits
And fuck you to anyone praying that I be falling cause I won't
I'm tryna give the youth some hope
Let you know you ain't alone, stay strong, untie the rope, it ain't a joke
We all tryna stay afloat, but the doctors don't understand us, they give us pills to cope and that's a joke
And as I'm rowing in this boat
Paddling against my depression, I'm sinking in this moat and I just mope, yeah
And I ain't got the right words to say
Everytime I think of fuckin speaking I just choke, and that's the realest shit I ever spoke
I been tryna get clean but I keep dropping the soap
So I smoke to stay high all the time to get by with my life
I don't really wanna die, so I'm high all the time to stop thinking
Cause I'm numb to the pain, I'm thinking fuck the fame
Motherfuckers try to come at me, I've dug up my grave
My split personalities are fuckin one in the same
I saw this post by Karat Kev, got me thinking bout my legacy
Will my enemies remember me? Wanna be legendary
I'm tryna be something that they will never be
I let em in, I let em see everything inside of me till I rest in peace
And I made it pop without ever making a melody

But instead I peck got a neck that’s so long

Ok fellas this is it
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

Ballin'
Talk is cheap, the bodies start to fall in
Rumors rappers are leanin on the wall again
Going all in, watch me put the pause in
What your man got, dawgs out there banging like Bangkok
Smoke clears we leaving off the main lot
Time's up, when the bass drop

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
You don’t hear me though
See your little bitter comments on the videos
Your peers and your ears bumping my material
See me, yo I’m the shit just in general, what [?]
They’d shoot me, I’m made you look
Never lying, landmine in my ramble
Crunch time on the grind got the line hooked
Fat dime think I’m lying got them all shook
You ain’t all that, 150 shows a year what you call that
Couple bad bitches groping on my ballsack
Fuck a fiend that could, pussy sipping cognac, haters fall back
1 O’Clock I’m getting the dope spot
The person with the pack raising the cap to smoke guap
Fiends is steady coming, the money it won’t stop

I'm in this bitch like I don't give a fuck, I've got an extra pair of testicles
I fuck your bitch then fall asleep on the couch with my draws and the tv on
That afternoon I killed you first, then cut up the corpse with Stevie Stone
Life in the jungle wasn't shit that my mama could teach
Should've used a coat hangar to kill me when I was a fetus
Go eat a Snickers cause you rappers just bitches and beavers
Fucking cupcakes, faggots with feminine features
I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis

Teenage pregnancy by a deadbeat
Still saw potential in you on our first meet
You drove a car that was smokin' fumes wit leaks
I put you in that white range, with the red seats
You was at the crib while my ex was at the door
I got mad bitches and you knew this from before
Dope Boy Troy make the girls go crazy
That ain't gonna change just because we had a baby
I never said I would be faithful, not at all
You ain't bring up other chicks while we shopped in the mall
In your Louboutin, David Yurman charm, Birkin arm
In the biggest trophy lil row rose supermom
But it's just a pacifier you go back to bein' buggy
Cryin' I don't love you, I'm like bitch I love my money
And I give you that, but that ain't proof of nothin give it back
Could of bought Ferrari's gave another chick a kid with that
You don't appreciate me and that's insane
Can't name a nigga that would buy ya house in ya name
I never fuck your family or your friends brought them shame
Would've put you on now you'll get put on to his game
Most men cheat, most men cheat, that is true
Only kind that don't is the kind you ain't attracted to
So here go ya choices, me or them
And if you don't choose me you probably cheat on them

Big money, drug usin', violent discussions
All type of artillery that he ain't bustin'

You had a child before rap ya baby moms is nothin'
And show you all the pros not the cons of wealth
As soon as it turns you calm you been conned yaself
Listen lil man I'm designed to do me
Started at 10 grams then I got to a key
Knew that this wasn't the end for me
Knew I was gonna try to get out the streets eventually
I opened up businesses legitimately
Listen to opportunity presented to me
It's true though, I surpass most niggas that you know
I'm connected my plug look like he was in Menudo
I'm more Rickey Henderson to woods then Martin
Runnin' base, runnin' through hoes I'm just startin'

Rest in peace Aunt Maddy

A black queen in corona Queens by way of Alabama
Had a brother Uncle Junior he showed me my first hammer blaow
Wow, I was only 8
When you first made me sweet potatoes, ah it was great
And the taste, of the melted marshmallows what I crave
You would smoke ya cigarettes, tell me don't talk in spades
May my ace boon coon, and a bit of a joker
Drenched me with the water hose cause by mistake I super soaked ya
One of the funnest times of my childhood
Thinkin' back on it Aunt Maddy you was wild hood
Drinkin E&J, numbers you would play
Cover up the smell of burnt reefer with a spray
In the driveway always kept you a caddy

Dig my nails into it, blood dripping out

How do you force yourself to go on when you've got no self-will?
Wanna chain smoke a whole pack, they all tell me smoking kills

Imagine having someone there to wash your pain away
But I can't grasp that thought, that's not the life for me
I don't know how to love another person easily
I'm alone for now and I think that's the only way
I said a lot of things that I probably shouldn't say
I've let a lot of people down, so what's the price to pay?
I can't reference what I'm thinking, not my game to play
Running faster as the light that's in me starts to fade
Why live real life? I'll just stay here watching anime
Taking three pills even though they're only one a day
Put me in a coma so I can't communicate
And pull me down to hell 'cause heaven's just too far away
The wounds upon my body bleed 'til they disintegrate
But scars are left, I can't forget that this is not okay
And how it hurts the ones who love me and my family
If they saw me in this state, I don't know what they'd say",3561410,en,en,en

Ladies and gentlemen
I have returned
Yet again
Today's topic is
Curious about crazy, mm-hmm
Are you irresistibly drawn to crazy lovers
Question: Can love be an addiction?
Can physical attraction be an addiction?
(physical attraction can definitely)
(right definitely)
Is love like a drug?
(yes)
Yes

[Verse: Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire]
I think my ex is satan in the flesh, long hair, nails and a dress
Prolly caught a n**** slippin but who cares, I digress
Why you all up in my mental with your stank-ass breath
Just another n**** you fucked, another nut, who’s next?
I was pumpin ‘til I erupted on your flat-ass chest
And use a rubber and use nothing I was searching for death
Searching for love that’s why i smothered you is not complex
We used to choke each other when we fucked to cut off our breath
Syrens sung a song to Homer just to cut off his neck
Erykah Badu had Common wearing crocheted hats
For every Yoko there’s a Heather Mills collecting a check
For every rapper there’s a groupie scheming on the event
Love is more a game of questions, not quite a game of chance
Better yet, a game of patience no answers in romance
Better yet, it’s not a game for you it’s more a tournament
You place your issues over pride, you put your present verse’ your past
Ot was lust in the first place I was scared that it would last
Couple nuts in a dirty telly room over by graham street
Came and you want your birthday that was your gift
We both supposed to be responsible adults, look at this shit
Was I just another n****? Were you just another bitch?
Was it just another memory or caution lost in bliss?
Wouldn't ask you to stay ‘cause that’d just be forcing shit
Now what I really wanna know is…
Who are you really?
[Excerpt: Zo Williams]
Who is more to blame...or who is more subject to this
The male gender, or the female gender
Not being able to pick up crazy on an attractive motherfucker
(ooh I think the males don't pick it up)
Because men have been socialized to hit it and quit it
(sometimes, unless it’s too good, then they can’t— they wanna keep hitting and—)
I will say
(they like playing with fire)
I’m guilty of that
See first off you have to understand the male science
(Okay how— explain to us— explain)
The science of man-ness is
“The best way for me to understand her is to fuck her”
(Okay, well, you know what— so even though she crazy let me hit that real quick though)

Maybe I should put this gun in my mouth now and clear my mind
But before I can greet death
I just tell myself “deep breaths, you just need rest”
Lay down and relieve stress
Then wake up and repeat steps

Won't change

Verse:
The sharp edges of reality are cutting me
Feelings dwelling from within steady bugging me
Can't plead guilty thoughts in my head catch me muttering
Movin slowly thru the dirt, engine sputtering

My anxiety is crying
My eyes ran out of tears
Coz im living and im dyin
Im still haunted by my fears
Pain and pleasure are so indifferent
The highs and lows are so magnificent
Life is fickle and so belligerent
Yet its beautiful and so damn innocent

Coz im feeling red, with this existential dread

Fallen deep into curse
Stuck in coffin of hurt
Soul is demolished and burned
Keep making mistakes until i never learn
This point there ain't no return
Paranoid bout every word
But i will rise up from the dirt
Though every circumstance has been adverse

Turn all my losses to lessons
Theres good in the bad like there's sin in the blessings
Life will be fine for minutes, for seconds
Im self medicating until i feel better

And maybe theres hope
Maybe there ain't
Im braving the cold and embracing the pain
Whenever it rains it abrasively pours

I assure theres no cure
I can't fall asleep any more
Lifes a rose with its thorns
Beauty and pains true form

My brain feels dead can't shake this existential dread

No relaxing, I can’t kick it

To maintain my position

Critics say I’m bragging
Bitch, I’m just living my life
I know this shit looks so lit
& that’s probably cuz it is

I ain’t gotta stretch the truth
You ain’t never seen me fake it
Slaying the beats, i am a beast
You ain’t never seen me naked

Haters disrespecting, discredit
I don’t let it
Affect my life’s position

Healing the people gives me life

In the darkness, I’m the light

Smoked out
Tryna find a way out
But they just don’t know how

Single mothers being fathers
Working till they so tired
Just to put food on the table
You got me inspired

I just wanna show my city
There’s always another option
If you don’t like your position
Homie, we could get it popping
No stopping- this the coast
Put ya drinks up, this a toast
Imma take you with me
In my pocket everywhere I goes

Yeah, I do this shit for you
For the fans, for the haters
Yeah, I’m crushing, not a player

I’m a rapper, I’m an addict
I’m a human with some habits
From food stamps to 5 stars
Chola living lavish

And I feel so blessed
Damn, I feel so humbled
No mumble, this some real rap
Tell me, can you feel that

Do this for my people
Cuz I can’t forget my hood
I put on for my city
Always rep it, like I should

While you clowns stop in whips, man I'm playing with ships

She like “Yo, Bronze, I love how you cook”
When fans spit the sun out, it turned to onyx daze
My moon’s bright, spend white nights in an angel’s gaze
Dorothy Dandridge manuscript, pretty as your daughter’s kiss
Black clouds, high noon, rain on the nemesis
Words made of Qu’ran pages, you never stood by
And saw thoughts so clear, as a man’s breath in winter time
You saluteable Jesus feet, glow like the furnace
Voice like Rushin’ waters of Vodka from a thermos
Half baked brain case, love how your dame taste
You sour as welfare milk weeks beyond the keep dates
Blunts is snake skin coils, I gotta alotta top soil
Throw it on coffins, with nails from Mosque Halls
Swim-fan bitches, pools of pre-cum in my britches
Wipe it on her fat ass, fuck tissues

Missed calls piss off many
Bitch y’all ready? Quickdraw disarm any
Shit off this already
I tell my slutty buddy she so bad
It’s kinda funny fronting from the back
I’m just tryna’ cheat on death up with a thotty
I keep on bungee jumping till’ I smash
This off Henny, wait said this already, carried away with the pen and pad
I forgot your ass was just the middle man
Sorry I just got a short attention span

This shit bout to get hot and heavy
Like these thots attending, so y’all not forget me
Good luck bitch only suicide could get me
Bout to slit a wrist, cause every line is deadly
Like a god already, you be flashing guns
But that pump fake, you need to juke less
Feeling bad for anyone below me
Cause I just came off the top like it’s roof sex
Who’s next? Look over and she said “Me gladly”
GPS CVS, I ain’t sending addies
I just asked ma, what it is?
And she said “You sonned it and left it a dead beat daddy”
Now honey mooning like we getting married
But I still keep a bitch on hand like Siri
I just told my main bitch to be comfortable up in her own skin
Then we both went tanning
She give me more favors when we leave the party, that’s a goodie bag
Hit KXNG for a feature, then I hit the boos so first I got Crook then got crooked man
Treat a toe like a post, not a rapper or snapper that I, the G fuckin’ couldn’t tag
Bout to pound a bitch, that I couldn’t smash, if I didn’t prey on the gram like I could in mass
I need an angel ass with waist tall tats
Can take all that, and make hoes yack, and wake up smacked
Your face all cracked like eight Ball smacks
Cause we don’t bat a fuckin’ eye, unless it’s with a fuckin’ baseball bat
We napalm that, then take off scat!

You see an opportunity to help someone who's sick
I see a chance to be a dick
I can't change the way I am
But I feel like if I fake it till I make it I can be better
But what if some people aren't meant to be better
I'm meant to be a hater
Shit on Billie Ellish because my ex liked her
Hate on your decisions cuz I don't have enough confidence to make my own
I'd be willing to give away the little that I own if it means my cold heart would part from my chest
I wish I could be normal like the rest
But I'm just me
Some people tell me to embrace it
Write my poetry and ignore the hared
But I can't ignore the hatred when its in my head
Saying that I'm better off dead
Telling me to grab a Glock and fill myself with led
I'm fed up with dreams
I'm fed up with disappointment
But there is no cure
Or no ointment
I'm just a bad guy, a bad guy
I'm just a bad person I don't know why I try
Make my girl cry, my girl cry

I don't know why I am how I am

Wanna grab a gun and make it go blam
Make it go blam

Wish I could go back to when I wasn't suicidal every day
All mama wants to do is help my pain go away
Maybe I should go back to the hospital
Talk to a therapist about how I'm so non-committal in every relationship
My emotions like to do a flip
Make my ego as hard as a brick
I swear I don't know how I look in the mirror that long
The thought of talking to myself makes me sick
Crack in the mirror
I feel my fear seeking out of my head
I'm getting sent to a bad place
Somewhere worse than being dead

Shit Satan's back inside my head
""You wonder why you are this way
But you should know

Will Generation X survive the internet?
Microwave knowledge to benefit, been a threat
Third eye blind mystically illiterate
Ignorant impossible to expect me to give a shit
Hearing me calling conspiracy theory in fear we follow
Mentally weary it's
Tyranny over the mind's memory
But a well designed enemy
Clinically brain scattered
Chemically imbalanced
Express malice, such untapped talents
Told what we know with an immense challenge
Look at those to control this is all out madness
Keeping us from the knowledge
Let us suffer in silence
Terminating the vermin there's veterans of the violence
Reaching for what's inside us
No one is gonna guide us
Don't see the obvious or don't bother looking behind us
Keeping in mind to how fine Nicki Minaj is
Or Louis Vuitton see the sign to the designers
Will they design a new bomb to drop on us
New microchips, satellites and narcotics
It's crazy, we puppets
Tap into Twitter and trigger our favorite topics

She ain't about the flash

Won't ever run with it

[Verse 1]
She don't like the spotlight
She play in the background
Spot her with her friends now
Model with her head down
Living in the zone, looking like a star with her own[?]
Looking like a queen at a thrown
Never turn off, you'll forever burn on
Heaven would fall if you ever got lost
Now haven't you thought if you ever were gone
That's everything wrong so I rather you not

But that's how it's supposed to be
She close to me
I wanna pull her out the sky, hold her close to me
And she different she wild I can see it her eyes

Meet her on top I can see that she fly
See that she shine, anyone can see that she fine
But only I see that she shine
She too independent, hold it against it [?]
The world in her palm but she don't want attention

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change a thing on you
My funny valentine
This is true
It's that charm and the out of line
Hard to find
But harder to miss
It's hardly a wish
The whole thing starts with a kiss

You a little off key but I get you gorgeous
Give me your space till' we get in orbit
Let's get on it, let's be on this
The stars collide so best be cautious
The way you view, the way you move
Is elegant, evading dudes, that playing you
I'm loving it, from across the room
You still cross my view
I can't help that I'm drawn to you
I see the world pass watching a girl dance
We flyin' first class over to her pad
And I can see what you are, see you that far
Through the city lights, I still see you a star

About you, about me, about me
About my body's withdrawal
Every time you leave

I'm addicted to your choke
I'm an addict for the static
That has bitten my soul

Of my mind, of my mind

Get focused
Get focused
Get focused

You may say you’re walkin’ up the street
Packin’ heat at the people you meet
But I don’t care I don’t shed a tear
Nigga, you could be the best of the worst
Just, be by my side be a witness to the curse
Never be the source
In the realist of the situation
Why do the nations, war against nations?
When did it all begin?
Homie when will it end
I’ve seen the generation’s high intentions
It seems like
Total destruction
Is the only solution
To ease the tension
Bob Marley mentioned that
There ain’t no stoppin’
Ain’t nobody who can stop ‘em
You’ve gotta do ya thing don’t get caught up in the system
We gave, Babylon one inch and they took a yard
Give ‘em a yard now they’re takin’ a mile
Don’t cry
Once a man and twice a child
Everythin’ is for awhile
Don’t be takin’ it high
False prophets come preachin’ just to fool ya so they can rule
That’s why I kill with the rockets
I don’t care I ain’t got a conscience
When I demonstrate is for once ‘cause there’s no second chance
Focus ya mind
You niggas need to focus ya mind
Get focused
Y’all need to focus ya mind
You bitches need to focus ya mind [X2]

Yo I peep the game closely and I never choke
From the east the coast chose me now I’ve got the toast
I was born in the west but I represent the east
Brookfields, Freetown, from where came the beast
I learned the game from the homies that’ll never put the heat down
Out of control, we could never let the streets down
These niggas don’t know what they do
It’s unusually true
They’ve got me losin’ my cool
Player haters in the game and they’re scared of competition
Fuck rap, ghetto niggas got their own ambitions
So when a wack Mamma Jamma tries to rock the mic
I lose passion
Get the punk out of my sight
Don’t wanna listen to ya message
I’m lynchin’ off ya nut bag seed with the essence
I can’t help it
Yo I hate these haters when they’re trippin’
Shit, they’ve got a bricklayer dippin’
For the cheddar
Focus ya mind
You niggas need to focus ya mind
Get focused
Y’all need to focus ya mind
You bitches need to focus ya mind [X2]

Chewin’ on bones
Ready to desert my home
With the hoochies, cause daddy wouldn’t let me roam
I’ve gotta booze
Because I’ve got nothin’ to lose
Except for my life and it worthless
The shit is gettin’ hopeless
Cause the leaders had to rogue us
Shit the bogus
No job for the lawyers, and intellectuals
After slavery, the white man deserted us
Watchin’ our currency drop and bleedin’ soldiers
Yo the rebels, they want human rights more than twice so they slice up
And if you don’t like it you’ll get diced up
That’s how it is on the block
The rude boy psyche, gotta chill with the mac
Being attacked by thieves
Jealous mutha4kaz and enemies
Act elementary I’ve got to be killin' G’s
I’ve gotta be a G cause I’m psycho
Blowin’ my mind with the endo, pull up the window
Here’s a match spark a puff you've seen, we’re protected
We’re uplifted because we’re gifted
With no witnesses, there can’t be any life sentence
East end niggas make no repentance
Always ready to give in to temptation
My niggas better watch ya step
Always ready to give in to temptation

You had crossed the line, but I had just let it slide

But at the end I would take you back a thousand times

Too high up ain’t coming down
Load my problems like hunnid rounds
Wrap em up like big pounds

That’s another hit  just made another brick
Been stacking up them chips

Still with my brothers nigga we still on that hustling shit
Money coming in neva goin out that’s what it’s all about

I was in a drought in that pain and the struggle nigga , that’s what helped me out
Made myself a boss , had to pay some cost
Had to pay my do’s now I’m finally do

Put the album out myself, shorty, I don’t need a clearance
Tryna to block my route, dawg, we call that interference
Ain’t nothin' like the feelin' of a crowd when they cheerin'
Shouts out to all the baby mommas and they children
All the hip-hoppers and the ballers in the building (ha)
So thanks for lettin' me live my dreams
So before I leave the stage, shorty, let me hear you scream

Two finger salute
It's hard to see the sun from the booth
I used to daydream, visions of me sittin' in the coupe
So they bout to call me Twista how I'm rippin' off the roof
We're no longer in Kansas
How do you paint when there's no longer a canvas?
The fans make it for you when they puttin' they hands up
I'm feelin' so high, the camera can't even pan up
So stand up, put your hands up if I'm next up
I don't use gimmicks, I don't play dress up, so 'fess up
There's a reason they think of me as Superman
I've got these people singin' my praises like Luther Van
We go to studios just to play who's a fan
I got these other rappers shoppin' for some movin' vans
I'm havin' dreams of the days when I used to plan
Don't wanna be a star, but I could use the fans
Yeah, yeah, you need to give me that
I'm 'bout to give you hits till you wanna hit me back
And from the jump, I had power like Mario
'Cause I'm the triple crown and they the merry-go-round
And it don't get better than some high school losers

Pussy run the world
Spending time on a girl
Who knows that she runs shit
Regret getting her digits
And even then I still fidget
Because I fucked around
I'm an addict looking for a fix
Hmmm, yeah she caught wind of it
Got me like bark on a tree
I ain't leaving it
Crazy one with thick thighs and shy eyes
No wonder she don't hang with them other guys
And I'm just so high, I'm not any other guy, so lets just fly
We've been through so much
Can't we just get along?
I know I made so many songs
I'm just tryna right my wrongs
I miss kissing up on you and playing with your lace thong
Fuck the pain, 'til it's all gone
And you know what your boy been on
It's been more lit than xenon
And any track I drop, these people feind on
Don't you get it? I'm a phenom
Just tryna see your nasty side, I'm a demon
Tell me have I ever done you wrong? Yes? Girl, come on
Always been about you, shit ain't changed
But why the fuck do you gotta keep playing
Would you miss me if I got on a plane
And it crashed before it touched the ground again?

Eyes closed, eyes closed, alot on your mind
I will keep you under my wings
I'm nasty in the sheets
You're my everything
Eat you up, looking sweet
Baby, I see rain in your eyes
Laughter in your hands
And I know sometimes I don't understand
How you're feeling
But I'm out here, making a killing
No one as strong and beautiful to me than you
Tell me what you're feeling
This the type of love
Make you think about her every morning
And afternoon, and evening
And night
You thinking about marriage
No doubt, shit I might
Give you that ring
Give you that ring
Shit so shiny
I don't know how you found me
But I'm not so lost, Mami
I'd rather want you on me than around me
You're my everything
The one I'll come to when its time for settling
But for now I'm flying with these wings
My earth child, you're so far, but so close
You look beautiful with or without clothes
You're a little crazy, and a little lazy

Time Flies,rap,Anarky,2017,35,{},"[Verse 1: Anarky]

Kicking writtens off the top it’s a given I won’t flop
Half the rappers in the game just gimmicks, (gimmick)
I’m not
Yeah time flies, I been at this for only a year
And now I’m showing signs of life cause I’m the only one here
All my crew got lost and found they own other paths
Turns out it was just me who wanted to rap
Lit the flame and burned a bridge with a couple of friends
Turns out they didn’t wanna see me in the ends
Never worked so hard to prove anyone wrong before
Then I went off just feasting like a carnivore
Always played the end of the joke but it didn’t appear
Now I understand and that’s the whole reason i’m here
Mind pains was the song had 1 and a 2
Went from recording on phones to getting hundreds of views
Now I climbed my way up to the top of tho food chain
Then the golden age came yeah I’m talking the new thing
(just playing)
A person told me that they fucking with the movement I got
I appreciate it cause I work and do this a lot
I think they like my shit more than me it’s really a pain
But I got 800 plays I mean who can complain
Cause every time I drop some shit and it come from the heart
And really love what i made for once feeling smart
Then I barely get played and I can’t understand
The world slipping away from the palms of my hands
Cause i don’t wanna be a sell out, but how can I sell out
When i’m the only one liking the shit I’m about
And it’s all in my mind tryna get me some clout
When my closest friends don’t support me when I’m around
And it’s all the basic shit that’s gon get all the plays
And i lied to myself when I said I’m not fazed
And they all love the kid i am fucking amazed
I don’t even get the credit when he steal a whole page
I’m the mastermind, the ghostwriter, supporter & and chief
And yet it’s times when I’m feeling I don’t wanna be me
Cause I rather be the one in the light all the time
But the real shit I make never get any shine
I'm just tryin'
And I lie all the time, when I say that I’m fine
Cause the fame in the spot not gon wait til it’s mine
People cutting me off can’t even spit a line
And the clock is running low right now ain’t no time
[Verse 2: Anarky]
Survivors guilt I be living in a cave
Til' this bullshit came around and started new waves
Everybody wanna rap now, be a lil' whatever
Who the fuck gave them the game? Now they gon' get it forever
Cause as long as nobody care as listeners do
Like chance 3 we gon' see hella dread-head dudes
With the colors in the hair like they running this bitch
I’ll be there but i’m just starting and i’m talking my shit

Win awards and catching breezies incredibly easy
Land a reality show and do my co stars greasy

And joselyn thinking why he chose that over mimi
But won't tell him until we almost done with my cd
And built my bridge with zino over at hip hop weekly
Do a hook for jay and hope that it land me a deal
With rocnation and book a studio session and chill
With engineers saying whether or not im a star
Or will i make it past 18 months and go far
Im at war with myself cuz mainstream calling my name
But every song i done played for moms keep saying i changed
I can tell its for the worse she ain't smiling no more
Tryna convince her it ain't all about talent no more
But the more i explain the less she understands
The trouble of trying to keep my number one fan
My number one fan a disparaging title
Not everyone will like you the next american idol
America i invite you to judge my every flaw
My embarrassing flaws, these incredible walls
Break down and let you explore
A veteran star trying to hold it together folding up during his tour
Audience members gossiping reading these blogs
Holding signs and yelling comments im tryna to perform
Celebrity lesson 1 aim at perfection
Thats what makes you beautiful you get one direction
You not progressing you failing

And watch me curl in a fetal position and cringe

Felt this way for a long time
Spent too many long nights
Thinking how I wanna be with you
But your feelings weren't true
Yeah you're not you
See I don't understand
How you can just fake it
I cant take it
Saying that you hate this
Talking all this fake shit
Took my heart to break it
And say this wasn't it
I don't understand
You took me by the hand
Led me to a land
To where you would just break me
Yet I still love you
Why you playing with my heart
Tear that shit apart
You can see the scars
Of where you broke it down
Now you see me frown
Lying in the depths of my mind
Wasting all my time
Thinking you were never mine
And I can't feel alright because
[Chorus]
All my time was wasted, thinking bout you
I've never loved someone, like I love you
And all the time that you said you loved me too
It was all fake
Why'd you make my heart break?

So many long nights thinking bout you

But you never cared and I had no clue

Rebel vs. Gravity,rap,Lecrae,2013,2808,{},"[Intro]
This is a duel — a showdown
Mr. Rebel vs. Mr. Gravity
What up Mr. Gravity? I just got some words for you

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. Gravity, what up, I see you took off
Now you bigger than ever but to
Me it's like you took off
Clocked out, no longer a witness to the nations
Are you playing the background or really fame chasing
You sold out, used to
Be souled out
Now you just tweeting 'bout how your concert was sold out
Dudes be making songs talking bout that they all worry bout you
I'mma keep it real, my stomach turns at your current route
Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't mean so much to me
Your music changed me, now it's just disgusting me
And I assume it's the fame and the money, power and influence
You just tryna be accepted, headed to your ruin
And me? I'm just doing what you was known for doing
Bringing the truth hard
Hoping that it gets through
Somebody had to say it, might as well be me
And P.S. please don't corrupt KB
[Bridge]
Wow, that's how you feel Mr. Rebel?
I mean.. it's all love in grace but let me just talk to you

[Verse 2]
Ay look, dear Mr. Rebel
Young brother I understand
You feel like I let you
Down, like I'm misguiding all these fans
Truth is I feel arrogant and even self consumed
Explaining my motives to all
Of these people who've assumed
It's not about the money and trust me, I hate fame
Made some interesting moves while playing this chess game
And honestly did change, but never for the change
Maturity's given me liberties that I wouldn't claim
Some of the very things I used to call abomination
Are things I couldn't handle but thank the Lord for His grace
I ask you to be gracious, people ain't always shaky
Some have different convictions and others gon' make mistakes
I'm a little bit of both and I ain't mad or offended
You can forgive much when you understand you forgiven
I done a lot of living, misjudged many people
Quicker to call 'em evil before
I knew 'em as people
I'm less self righteous, not seeker sensitive
The truth is we all deserved to die the way that Jesus did
I don't wanna make every song into a sermon
Go listen to your pastor, that's where you should be learning
I love you, I'm sorry that I'm not the man you think I am
But it was never me anyway, it's the great I Am
[Outro]
Ay man, I still believe everything I wrote on Rebel, you know what I mean?
Me bragging about where I been or what kinda mission trips I'm doing
And who I'm discipling and so on and so forth in every song doesn't make me more holy
And me not talking about it doesn't make me less holy
It's all grace baby, I hope we can have graces with me as the Lord has been gracious to us all
I love you",209378,en,en,en
Lost  Found,rap,David Chidiac,2014,22,{},"PART 1: LOST

[Hook]
Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night
I’m looking for happiness in a place that’s not right
So I take my dollars, but that don’t make much sense
So I head for the light, Head for the light

[Verse 1]
For my pick-six of life I pay the price
Comes with a dollar sign of the fucking times
Write my rhymes so I can pay my piper
Slow nose grind, call me a fighter
Unenthusiastic on the curb of life
So you'll have to Hold me down when you dump the ice
Cause Failure happens no more than twice
But success isn't always right
I'll Take my hits and rewrite and fight
The limelight set piece shines so bright
The concept is driven by my motivation
Power on and lead my fucking generation
Afraid of the consequences of doubt
Doing my best to figure it all out
The voodoo that I do make me sharp like ginsu
So you should beware when I slice right in you
And Approach the top with my peers and we feast
Walk through the valley heat with bare feet
The naked fire simmers leaving a hot streak
Penitentiary ambitions lead to defeat
The pain and struggle that stays on repeat
The arguments happen due to conceit
Overcome the struggles and leave with relief
Keep it short man boxers or brief
Cause the Adversary of peace never leaves relief
In the hands of those who struggle to be free
So take away all of the things that we seek
And you will leave people feeling helpless and weak
Struggle to the peak
Crouch below the surface
Peer up at your peers
Fight all of the madness spawned by your fears
This is our struggle
This is our fight
Our anthem rings on into the night
[Hook]
Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night
I’m looking for happiness in a place that’s not right
So I take my dollars it don’t make much sense
And I head for the light, Head for the light

[Verse 2]
My baby girls left she’s all outta sight
That’s what I get for being so bright
I don't care no more cause she outta mind
So I take what's mine and I Head for the light
She said leave me a sign something to help change my mind
Cause I’m stumbling blind trying to hide my pride
Cause I know I’m not right to have been so egregious to ya! Jesus!
But what can I say this is the game that I play as
Commiserative phantoms sing Promissory anthems
They Start by humming
Then Start the chanting
So I start the dancing
As They lift my soul
We Throttle the night stand
We Rock n roll
I hurt
But never cry
Pain hides behind smiles
Apothecary based Visions of sadness Cloud my mind
This is the madness that we hide inside
This is the pain I strive to fight
This is the choice that I made for life
These are the people that I love for life
Show me some thing worth the fight
Give to me the happiness I'm worth tonight!

PART 2: FOUND

(sweeping harps and romantic melodic 808 beat)

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling so cheezy
The air is so breezy
The wind on my face feels like your touch
Your lack of a presence
Is making me question
All that I have cause you were my crutch
I need your opinion
I'm feeling resentment
I crave every chance to look in your eyes
Your mystery scares me
Oh how it dares me
Pushing and pulling on my mind
Your are so perfect
It's making me nervous
I need to calm my nerves in a rush
I'm begging and pleading
Oh your misleading
All of my moves are all but crushed
[Hook] x2
So Baby Please!!
Look deep in your heart
Cause I have
Loved you from the start
And I Know x3
I know it's true
That what I have
Was made for you!!

[Bridge]
There ain't nothing bad that I ever did for you
For you, for you, for you

[Verse 2]
So would you please
Could You Please
Tell me what you think
About the choice I made
That's put me on the brink
Cause I know x3
I know I need You
And You Know x3
You always will too
So let's go
Let's go far
Away from all that is hard
And I'll show you
Whats deep in my heart
And you'll see
It's been there from the start
So let's go

Prophecies,rap,Cheb Amin,2017,208,{},"I'm just tryna buy some free chilly
But they seemed to tell me prisoners are at ease
I'm caught in a bit of a Seattle freeze
But who is corrupt
Potentially, all of us
The way these punishments vary provides cries, provides wise
Provides the ability to apologize
Look at the eyes of your eyes
I'm just continuing to assume
A wise man once told me we are too focused on what's flashy
We were stuck in a valley
Exploration for humanity continuous for planetary advancement
But I just assume it's at a permanent expansion
Or at least to our understanding
I don't have a source of entrancement
Maybe this is it
Still we don't have the will
At least we will fight with you for the bill
A mix of laziness yet ultimate skill
That's what stops us from finding thrill
Maybe once we get over beverly hills
We can feel
What will be coming
So Hi/Hy Brasil
That’s right, hello
This has got me all blue even though it's called yellow
I keep focusing on what I won't see, so
I'll continue to watch you shine, but me i'll glow
I seem to prefer the intros
I am just playing ping-pong
With the idea of king-kong
I think physical pain is my motivation to be at the top, while the rest is just a test of whether my will can be still strong
I'm gone, so long
You can't talk to me, I'm too busy studying the stars
Or reading the Qur’an on mars
Or writing bad bars on what's behind their bars waiting for us inside our hearts
I used to spend my time creating by looking at your cards
In school that's cheating but in the real world it's part of it all
So don't let me fall
I know that i'm gonna call I know that you aren't gonna respond to my brawl
So just continue to stall from ignorance
But where is that place we can reach blissfulness
When we connect sites the idea of finding at Atlantis isn't too ridiculous
Continue to misinterpret what's mandatory and drown yourself in alcohol
We weren't ready to have Willy Wonka in the long haul
The year is 1389
And proof is given that predicted the moonlight
And give or take 50 years later I was listening to sunshine
That’s right
I have got a 6th sense
I can understand the light
Different frequencies, different colors on the spectrum aren’t just in my sight, but are 100% understood in my mind
What you can't put into words, I can just fine
Apparently I have the right to die 77 times and that's not a crime
So i'll continue to try and find
The signs
Hit up chapter 5 and head to the 32nd
Then tell me that I need to start repenting
They don't understand the message we are sending
But this has all happened before and it will happen again
What we need is slowly killing us, don't you forget
Did we not give them evidence?
Their insults are irrelevant, nothing except what they'll accept
From the fiddler we got more than they expected
I'm not a Mandinka warrior but tears don't come from their descendants
Supposedly like Malcolm X
You're so smart, so intelligent
For things we didn't do, we want credit
I think i'm gonna fade away like Logic
Or disappear like Tyrell Wellek
Instead of finding myself stressed like Tom Selleck
One day we will stumble upon an ancient relic
That'll prove Alavi right, and all of the sceptics
Will still find a way to forget it
I just, just hope they won't regret it
But I respect it
Yeah
I just suggest you
Listen but I expect you
To expect me to protect you
To everyone at the school, I will never forget the day I left you
I will never forget the day I met you

Stand Straight,rap,Mario William Vitale,2017,12,{},"Bottle caps, joints and blunts in the ashtray

Not worth doing anything half way
Especially if today is my last day

Near and far from any cascade
Spending time in the fast lane

Now ain't that strange
I don't know why so many cats play

I got a lot to offer the rap game
Made by using my hands and brain

It's a damn shame
When someone gives something legitimate a bad name

And what some are willing to do to try and grab fame

Some get a kick out of boasting about how much cash came
If you couldn't ever hit the target, did you ever have aim?

Nothing like a crab cake
You talk too much crud, how does all the crap taste?
When things don't go your way, how quickly you get a sad face

Status,rap,Mr. Lif,2002,910,{Insight},"[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
I was mad dipped
Butterfly collars and shit
Chains from the slave ship
Dreads with the wave kit
Bifocals and wing tips
Velvet pants and a velour coat
Looked in the mirror
""Damn, I look dope""
Folded up the singles in my loot-clip
Put a sock in my pants on some Uncle Luke shit
Dressed to impress, now I'm ready to go
The club is twelve blocks away and I got no loot, so
I walk ten and take a cab for two
Black duct tape over the hole in my shoe
I've got the hottest dance steps
Running Man, Cabbage Patch plus The Robocop
Then I'll bring back The Wop
Jaws will drop and all the ladies will flock
Brothers thinking (What he got that I ain't got?)
I'll tell ya, fella
It's written in my bestseller
It started to rain
Shit, I got no umbrella
The walking turned to running
Still, I look stunning
Covered 'nuff ground before my taxi was summoned (Hey, taxi)
Got to the spot and hopped out at the front
Tripped over the curb, limping, 'cause my toes were stubbed
Then I tried to give pounds to people I didn't know (Yo, what's up, y'all?)
Like Lucy and Joe
My destination was the back do'
Not because the bouncer told me not to come back
I'm just sneaking in the club, because I got it like that
[Verse 2: Insight]
I remember when you used to be broke
Ignored when you spoke
And people would take you for a joke
You used to go to the club
And look like a scrub
But couldn't afford the admission
From outside, you're looking in
Waiting for a chance to slip by
You slide through the back door
But you wasn't supposed to be there
You'd look like an idiot if you got caught
But you didn't care
Just as long as you got your groove on
It was smooth sailing
They was playing the Thong Song
You're feeling shorty with the boots on
Cutting through the crowd sideways, it's time to move strong
To cool kick it, say something slick off the top
Flash your jewels, fix your suit
Fidgeting with your wristwatch (Mhmm)
But right when you was in the corner acting a big shot
They threw on some hiphop
People got on the dance floor
And a bouncer saw you standing at the corner near the door (Hey, you)
He started walking your way, to muscle you out
Since you refused to pay
So there was nothing for you to say
When he blew up your spot (I told you not to come back here)
And threw you out the front to the floor
Past the bar on the right through the double doors
You mumbled and swore, stumbled and tripped on the pavement (Goddamn)
People in line started laughing
When they threw you hat then
Screaming that you wasn't allowed back in
But that was back then, acting like nothing happened
You patted your Tims off, depressed from embarrassment
It could have been fresh, it would have been lavish
One day you'll make it and won't have to deal with this madness

​mr. master makes the world go round
High five, scientists!
Deal exclusively in blind spot and hindsight biases
And let me highlight this bit before I'm misunderstood
Yes, you can be this smart and look this good
Ya followin' me, camera guy?
Let's talk showbiz
Next time you see a street performer, don't give
That's called enabling
And you don't wanna get roped into
Some no talent hack's vain attempt to feign emotion
No offense
But that's the dishonest truth! Take it from me
A bloke with a chip on his shoulder and a chip on his tooth
Bully ball. Is that ref Hellen Keller? She should've called!
Greetings from the past, before America was fully walled
Greetings from the future after Buchenwald
I'm just kidding, Germany. You know I love your… guten tag
I don't rap fast, you listen slow. Half-time the video
Anti politico. Pro fat guy in a little coat
Triple jeopardy. Triple major in
Hidden Temple teams, Hitler empathy
And rectal hysterectomy
Batten down your snatches
I'm leavin' blood stains on AIDS quilt patches
It's all good in the woods until you play with matches

I’m just hangin’ on my balcony
Wrapped in a blanket with Paris Jackson
Talkin’ about how framed her dad is
Here’s a headline for ya:
“mr. master found dead inside-”
I got fans who’d jump in front of a bullet that I loaded
Who turn ultra up loud as they
Avoid eye contact with the homeless
The sticker’s the only reason they voted
And they know to spill the Kool Aid on the ground
And never keep up with the Joneses
Atta boy/girl/prefer not to answer!
Now you’re microwaving with hamsters!
You deserve a pat on the-
Y’know what? You deserve an entire Terry frisk pat search
Just keep your hands on the vehicle
I need to hide my badge first
You're not allowed to say everyone sounds the same
If you sound exactly like someone else
That being said
Everyone sounds the same!
Welp, I guess I have to blaze this trail by myself!
Rappers, I beg of you. If you’re going to commit identity theft
At least thieve from the best
Please, jock my steez! I insist, just leave me a little cred
Drop this vid into EasyBib and keep me in your cited texts
But then again, this style is kinda one size fits one, no?
It’s an art writing smart punchlines this dumb... ho
But did you see the invisible gorilla though? Rewind the video!
There’s so much more to ultra than you think you know!
A bottomless WaPo Pinocchio Rapid T Rabbithole
That chewed up Andy Warhol and spat out Andy Ngo
Teachable moment!
Next time, don’t let Fox News loose in a white-painted henhouse
And let bygones be rights wronged you never forget about

You play with me wrong and that K gon' spray
A nigga drip sauce like every day
I turned me to a boss at a younger age
Too much lean made me fade away, yeah
Ayy, gotta take a nigga to a brazy place
Bad lil' bitch like Amazing Grace
I ain't had shit, had to make a play
Niggas so brazy like 808, yeah
Pretty lil' bitch, long hair
Nigga come drum like snare
Try to be me, lil' nigga, that's rare

Look at my neck go blaow
You feelin' like the shit right now
Gettin' rich, gettin' lit right now
I ain't got moves like cow
Don't slip on your drip right now
Got a bad bitch, give me good mouth
She gon' swallow, ain't gon' spit it out
Oh, spend me some racks at the store
Ballin' like I'm on the Bulls
Ballin' like I'm takin' score
Fresher, they not in no morgue
And this is not love, I talk to the Lord, he tell me I'm blessed for sure
I vision the bucks, and sauce it all up, now I'm the shit, manure
Uh, all the way my diamonds shine
All the way they bling and blind
Want the drip, stand in line
If you pay mine, you dyin'
Hit you in your spine 'bout four or five times

Gotta ask this nigga if you can drop and all this
Gotta get permission and shit

[Verse]
Yeah, you niggas can't high-post and you know who seein' ya
How can you be antisocial on social media?
So remedial, drilled to the core, real as before
Too many cousins in your bed, you had to chill on the floor
Imagine tellin' older niggas on the court
Don't do that to lil' homie, fam, give him his ball
If your mama gave you a dollar, you could buy a whole meal from the store
Canned soda and chips, a pan on the stove with the fish
Let it land over the grits
He think he rich 'cause he know his mans owe him a brick
Go on a trip where the Crips and Bloods can co-exist
Let's go to Saint-Tropez, it's cold as a bitch
This the Atlanta Braves throwin' a pitch
I lost three uncles in three years, let's be clear
I walk these jungles beneath fear, and we here

Still don't give a fuck what you say
I'm cuttin' up your toupée
Wish my nigga O went rap before he said ""What's up?"" to Lupe

Been missin' they kid, I was hearin' them AMBER Alerts
Understandin' what hurts is pain-driven
All them days I was stuck in the rain that came with it
Can't complain, it'll drive you insane, we made different
In this game, gotta drive through the lane like Blake Griffin
Different game, same system

You'd be lyin' if you told me that you was a made nigga
You still tryna convince these crackers we ain't niggas?
You still tryna convince these rappers your chain bigger?
It's that feeling when Michael and Quincy just made Thriller
Martin told Coretta he wants whatever that came with her
A killer, this that 2022 J Dilla

Its just the way my mother raised me
Another day

Do it all just to survive

A new way to life this life
Its right about time I make my way away from this ditch

Don't reply
Found out

Guess I should've seen that coming
Lucky I don't beat that bastard down with a pistol whip

You'll never match this hustle
You'll never gather the guts
To cut everyone for something you love

Yo, grab a pen and write this down
And read it back to yourself and see how it sounds
It may sound like (Huh), that I'm just an MC
I'm not, I'm a prince of poetry
I don't sit down and write rhymes everyday
But people wanna sound like me anyway
So what I say, you better believe
Because what I've done, you'll wanna achieve
Call me an MC, but I'm claiming fame
Because you get a real chill when you hear my name
A chill that you get up and down your spine
Every time you hear me say ""LA Sunshine""

Love A God,rb,Nefertitti Avani,2021,84,{},"Verse 1
Writing verses to my lovers
Writing hooks for my groupies
So either way it goes I can always say I wrote this song for you
When your fucking other peoples minds, I hope you use a rubber
If you weren't such a sucker for love, you'd probably respect the demon on your shoulder more

Pre hook
And get high when you miss me
Drink when i don't call
Go out when your feed up
See me when you kiss her
Give that girl your all
But she won't know the difference

Hook
But you will, unfulfilled on a bitch full of lust
It could never be the same you and them, you and us
You can never fuck a human after you loved a god
You can never fuck a human after you loved a god

Now your gifted, you feel spirits
You know substance you can't deep dive all this surface
You want meaning, you want purpose
They don't do shit for you they don't deserve it

But you will unfulfilled on a bitch full of lust, it'll never be the same you and them you and us
You can never fuck a human after you loved a god

Verse 3
I know you leaving them to wonder
Giving wrong digits to these groupies
So either way it goes, I can always say that to me you stayed true
When Im fucking other peoples minds, I gotta use a rubber
If they weren't such a sucker for lust, they'd probably respect the angel on their shoulder more
Call me when you miss me
You ain't gotta stall
Get high when I show up
Feel it when you kiss me
Give this girl your all
And you will feel the difference

Spending hours looking at the screen but no-one’s calling
Can you tell me what I did
Can you please not shut me out
Please don’t leave me all alone
Tell me what this is about
I don’t know what I did
We were fine all along
Mmm you made me so weak now I struggle to stay strong
When did all this get f***ed up
Tell me where did we go wrong
Now there’s nobody to turn to
All I have is this song

Did you ever think that maybe I still care
Can’t you see the way you’re treating me

You’re gone

It’s understandable but not excusable
Murdering my feelings and still coming to the funeral
Probably numb to it
Signs flashing before my eyes
I was focused on the prize
Never noticed all the lies, now it’s all gone
It’s funny if I had a new chance I’d probably play the same song
Still act like there never was a thing wrong
It’s okay, be okay, girl I’ll still let you have it your way
Wrote a whole tape ‘bout the things I’ll say
Before it all falls down
I guess I’ll throw it all away
Was it worth it
Probably not
Better than before because you’re perfect
All them other guys don’t even deserve it
But you saw through me
Told you I was the answer and you still circled B

Eliza won't you tell me true
What ever has gone sour in you?
Where is the girl that I once knew?
Eliza, I beg of you
Tell me it isn't true

[Verse 2]
Sixteen years and several days
I've watched you as you've grown astray
So wild and foul
Unruly, untamed
Not as how you were raised and now you are going away

[Spoken Word Bridge]
Eliza's entire life was packed into a bag that night. Everything unimportant left behind. She'd departed for a place perched high above a glacial plane: The Athеns Asylum for the Clinically Insane. It looked likе some sort of castle or prison from your dreams. The type that wakes you up in the middle of the night with sweat and screams. Eliza's heart sank. She panicked and cried. She begged not to be locked away on the other side. But before she knew it, so suddenly, so quick, the nurse shut the door and it sealed with a click
She sobbed for three years 'til her tear well ran dry. And then she conjured up a plan to make an escape for it that night. So she slipped out the window, past the spring, lover's lane. She was almost home free 'til a search light hit her face

[Verse 1]
Eliza won't you tell me true
What ever has gone sour in you?
Where is the girl that I once knew?
Eliza, I beg of you
Tell me it isn't true

Eliza fell, Eliza swore
Her sleeping gown was muddied and tore
And they dragged her down to the basement
A lobotomy was performed
And Eliza was no more

Make the soul incomplete
She a cold dime

Cold and alone make you go crazy
Thought all along you were mine

The person that you care about the most just broke your heart
Just to be in the same room with them

You can't stand the thought
I've been there

How much longer can you take being treated so wrong
You're confused on what to do
But no matter what you do
You're gonna make it through

The size of a mustard seed

Cause joy comes in the morning

Joy comes in the morning
Have a little faith
Just a little faith

Maybe if I would have compromise,  then you would have stayed

I…
Heard every word that you said, but I swear I
Feel like…
It ain't right
When the pride getting swallowed up
But its on one side
Why i gotta lie, huh?
Not the only one...
Wit they heart in
Leave drama in the streets
Where it started
All we do is fight
Tried to keep tight
Now i’m on a flight
And i see u
Blocking my calls
And when i call back
I get the voicemail
But
Never call back
Bump into your girlfriends
Man, they some cold cats
You say fed up
I say we both that
When i was
Back home
All you did was talk - back
Never had a convo
More like backlash
I would say one word
Set the whole thing off
You get turnt up
I get turnt off
Come on

I think you got that
The selective hearing…
And the memory
Don’t make sense to me
Lovers to enemies
It’s like two of y’all here
A gemini, huh?
Reached an impasse
And that’s so sad
Was i so bad?
Well don’t hold back
It’s dirty water
Under the bridge
I got my own ways
And imma own that
But you talk like
My soul black
And its spread thin
Wit evil intent
If that's true and all
Then why you here?
Say no more
All you want
Wanna call shots
Take the safety off
When the smoke clears
You can see my path
Never look back
My past is that
What?

I know you've been real busy
Don't have time for emotional stress

You see, taking care of home
Means more than just the rent
It means calling now and then
On occasion, stopping in
And sometimes having flowers sent

Wasn't there to pick you up
Whenever you fall
If I didn't smile and compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot
Tell me what would you do

Oh, I think you take for granted
That I'm always gonna be here
This is your final notice
Soon I'm gonna disappear
I'm not asking for a whole lot
Just think of me now and then
If you don't know what I'm saying
I don't know how this love can win

What if I stayed out late

As you would have them do to you
You reap what you sow

Ignore a man when they up, now they wanna be down

Hit the corner shop for a juice, she hit me up to come round

Montell Fish: Yo, I think just...I guess I was making, like, this album and different things like that. Just many thoughts coming to my head of just, people-pleasing and- trying to make this for these people and this for that people, but the most important thing is just staying before God. Being honest, and just not thinking too- too much about all this stuff that really doesn't matter in the end. It's just stain before the audience of One.

L.M.R.O.B.,rb,Dave Tsimba,2021,4,{},"Vindictive of validation
Ashamed in the acclamation of being demon for once
I try to make it right if we both agreeing for once
You never meant to hurt me when being me was a one time thing…

I admit I got pressure that still provides at night
But I leave everything to sow incase the seams breaking
My job is stress and your trust in me is a lead danger
No wonder why I say don't drink but come home mean wasted

I guess it’s cause all my anger's stuck in this chalice
And either your momma loves me or holds me out on occasion
The feeling's still a resemblance to being stuck on probation
Where they watch you from a distance or never care if you’re awake

And all your friends at me All positivity for most but they still at me
I know you do just because I show love really
I always try to go put our difference aside
But I heard you say we cool and not the way that the distance applies

Took my raised from me that's the shit that the distance is tied
True love isn't measured circumstances your distance implied
That you have so much to worry bout but you answer your phone
Telling me your don't check it every now is a cynical lie
Love me Red or Blue And not because I'm indifferent with sides
That just stands for times you're either good or your different at times
Those nights when you're glad you got your one that is there to reside
Or screaming at each other but you still love each other inside

Realizing hopefully that the room here is changing the vibes
You brought me to my red the room where everything's p
Sometimes I wonder if it was you would you feel this ashamed..
But then even when you wrong you point me as the finger to blame…

This ain’t a two way
Back when on your couch we used to listen to your tunes babe
And we’d have discussion over Bryse and our marijuana amusement
For you the sound wasn't the only reason I was tuned in

I remember sitting at the gas station you asked me why I loved you
I chased you for some months and you seem to deny my retail
I get it babe but you don’t have to ask for all the details
Seeing all my friends get the chance to call you
And get you to come over

Smoke a little weed and drink a bit till your not sober
Or ask to teach you Spanish when you know it ain't that kosher
Or stay the same spot and same couch or your bed even
Your wall hit me the hardest that's the reason I can't sleep but
Apparently I’m the dumb and it's done when it's all closure
Cause I apologize for all the things that I didn't know of
And I apologized for all the things that I did know of
There's no fair treatment when the story is done nigga

Fuck all the wedding rings
Fuck all of the love or fuck the hatred I'm setting things
Don't bother me in the club in the future with petty things Cause I'll be living plenty to this life with some ready Tings

You may be ok but I'm not set on our mending things
Machine mystery stories but I”m not set on the meddling things
Let me live my life since you decided to do the same
Without telling me dog but I see things from a mile away

This is probably why this song lives deeply inside of your safe
Sayin I don't know the code but I'm the best when deciphering the case
That's why they read what I say and they leave me on read
It's pretty implicit when I know what'd I'd mean to you dead

And if your whim was put down to the Almighty, no worries, there shall be hope

[Verse 1: Tyrese]
I don't know why I've been making her feel this way
I ain't even smooth with my bullshit, I do it right in her face
It ain't like I don't love her, already gave her that ring
I hope you know, hope you know, how much I really wanna change
Why would I wanna wake up in the morning without you by my side?
And why do I gotta see you in tears just to make a nigga realise?

[Pre-Hook: Tyrese]
How do I explain it?
Every time I try to say no, I can't run from it

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
I'm sloppy with the cheating
Always catch me creeping
Don't ask me why I do it, cause I ain't got a reason
All I know is, I be doing dumb shit

Party all night and we like blowing them bombs
Suit game Gucci, steak at the Palm
Cootchie Lootchie, black tie, bring me them all
What it is, what it do, Snopp DO dub?
Is there any way that you can get us in the club?
Girl I'm buzzin' with a cousin and a set of twins
Diggin', duggin, shit here I go again
It's certain mo'fuckers that I run with
That keep me on some Bobby Shmurda dumb shit
I'm creepin' while you sleepin' but you woke up
Speak up, spoke up, make a nigga choke up
So right, so wrong, so what?

Picking and choosing, that lil' bitch with we
I woke up in the morning on TMZ, ooh wee

Uhm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy Black Ty's got a mean ol' arm
I got exposed when she went through my DMs
Now I got problems with my BM
I ain't wanna be him
Dumb shit, doin' the most when I know better
But knowin' better, and doin' better and showin' better
Dumb shit in these streets and doin' what I want
When I should be doin' what made you put me on
Your independant and smart, you got your own everything
Million niggas want you but I'm the one you're drawn to
Been through it all but you still hold me down
Got pain in your smile and you refuse to frown
Baby I'm sorry I embarrassed you
Walking in a room full of bitches I didn't touch and they ain't even banished
Your voicemail full but the text said read
I pray to God our love ain't dead baby I swear

[Verse 5: Tyrese]
I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again cause I swore that I was gon' change
Got me working overtime in my phone changing all these names all night
But the city so small, they probably end up talking
And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking
But I'mma take my chances to gamble either way
And why would I wanna start over when I got you at home?
Tryna get a million girls I'mma just end up alone

They say love is the strongest force on this earth

People jobs don`t come no bigger than the one we`ve got to do
If we don`t give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?

That`s why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend

And stop trying to hold on to it

Feelings that we've had always dismissed
The sun just stepped into it for the hell of it
But we found a way to resist
Cause it could get personal and flip
And I ain't tryna deal with that shit
So you just keep it down on the low
And keep it out of friendship, well that's it

[Verse 1: Rochelle Jordan]
Now I'm suppressing what's on my mind
You should bring thoughts to me one more time
And maybe we'll be caught up in a moment
And came out the closet you and I
We've been friends for some time
In the back of the mind there's always some doubt
But we're alone in here and the music's blaring
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

SET ME FREE,rb,Excuseme47,2014,62,{},"[VERSE]
I often wonder if I could afford the fancy things
Sometimes I think about the pleasure that it really brings
And if I had to think about the Pharaohs and the Kings
This mental slavery would have me wearing golden chains
This path I've chosen as an artist its my only flame
I'm still in college education entering my brain
The repercussions that we paying when we smoke and drink
Can you remember when the memory loss is setting in
We value money to a point where people suffering
Society build a propriety and then you win
But if I lose I got a message to reveal for free
With all of this will all my people really make it free

[HOOK]
Can you set me free
I don't want to be friends
This love is lost forever
So sad this is the end
But I'm glad you set me free
This showed me who I am
And now I'm doing better
You don't have pretend
Like you didn't set me free
[VERSE]
It nice to know I got some friends who really got my back
And if they make it to my shows I'll bring them to the front
That way they get to see up close just how I really stunt
Materialistic but that's not the way I wanna flaunt
Id rather show you through the melodies
It seems like you get more free shit as a celebrity
But what is money to man who never made a dollar
It doesn't matter if he reads then he'll become a scholar
[high/low] I'm tired of the raps talking bout the drugs
Cus if we in the trap can we make it to the love
With a dirty state of mind I'm just tryna get a scrub
If ya your momma raised you well then welcome to the club
Cus the money that we spend shows the power we pretend
That it seems we really have but it's missing like them dads
Good ol Father Time is the only thing I had
So it's ironic when I say that my moms is like my dad

[HOOK]
Can you set me free
I don't want to be friends
This love is lost forever
So sad this is the end
But I'm glad you set me free
This showed me who I am
And now I'm doing better you don't have pretend
Like you didn't set me free
[VERSE]
Now everybody lemme see you put your hands up
Now everybody lemme see you put your hands up
This is for my people if you ever been jammed up
Thought that you was lost and you'll never make it out
That's why I made this song see I wanna help you out
If I lend a couple dollars will that really help you out
But if I bless with you with this knowledge will you take a different route
I was raised in New York but I lived in the west and south
Georgia what It do cali what It do
I promise I'll be back when I'm on tour rolling through
Tryna be the best the only way I power through
Feel like neo in the matrix cus he had the power to
Change the way we think so we could be more powerful
Never giving up that's something that a coward do
If I was in for the money would the passion be the same
Could the point of this issue is be im tryna make a name
Just set me free

Glad i met you here along the way
The ups and downs don't mean a thing

Last Night Can We Move On?,rb,Montell Jordan,1999,228,{},"(Intro)
What time is it?
Oh, no
Oh, no

7 a.m. when reality sets in
See, last night we said and did some things
That we shouldn'ta did
I know the morning after's always harder
Than the night before, for sure
Now we're lying here
Trying to figure what we're suppose to do
We're both wondering if we're getting back together
Or I'm leaving you
We had one drink too many, one kiss too many
One ""No don't you say another word"" too many
And it led us to the morning after

1 - Last night when the love was too strong
We couldn't fight it and you stayed
Just a little too long
So for now it's morning and yesterday's gone
But can we move on?
We ask ourselves ""Why oh why"" a thousand times, yeah
And separately, silently in our heads
We rehearse the lines
I had a nice time (So did I)
I gotta go now (Me too)
Hit my pager (Certainly)
Call me later (Most definitely)

And then we leave

Later on that day around six
I get a call from you
The slight tremble in your voice let me know
Something wasn't cool
And if I could turn bak the hands of time
I'd go back to yesterday before we lost our mind
To see if we'd do it all again

Repeat 1

Stay or leave, be strong or weak
Decisions, decisions
It all seems so easy
If I knew then what I know now
I'm sure that somehow we'd have no regrets
Repeat 1

Repeat 1 while:
See baby
Last night you just looked so damn good
Yes, you did
And I was a proud man, proud man
Yes I was

Got my back anywhere I go

No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
My day one’s set in stone
Ima take this to the grave

Without you two
I am nothing

Who shudders as he passes my way

At a man who’s not like you?
Go clean the kitchen, you little rat
This man’s blood isn’t true’

But what is blood when I only see beauty?
When’s a Muggle ever been so pure?
Oh, father, brother, there is no other
He’s the only one, I’m sure

One day when I am all alone
I coax thе man inside my home
I offer him a tasty drink
And bеfore he even has time to think
He takes my hand, and we’re in love
My eyes fill with tears of joy
We’re married within a year
Like magic, I’ve gotten the boy
And what’s a potion when I only see beauty?
And who cares if our love isn’t pure?
I’ve finally got the one that I want
And we’ll be happy for sure, for sure

But I can’t take it any more
The wonder’s flowing in my head
For I cannot solve the mystery
Of the Riddle lying next to me
Too bad he doesn’t really love me
No, he’s just under a spell
I can’t live with the guilt, so I’ll just let him go
And myself as well

I stumble to a battered door
I scream, collapse; I’m on the floor
I cannot breathe, but I’m a mum
I touch my child and name him Tom

And what is death when new life is created?
And Tom Marvolo looks just like him
He will redeem my honor
And when he finds his father

Forgive me (Forgive me)

When her cannons spit lead

She went for open sea
Slipping through the allied maze
Whose radar couldn't see
Now the deadly game begun
With the home flee on her tail
And in the demonstration
She sank the hood and the Prince of Wales
Steaming on with dignity
Continuing her mission
Enjoying every victory
Reloading the cannons

Goddess of destruction

And now I'm holding onto
A thousand reasons

And tomorrow is another day

And if I never say good-bye
I'm only waiting for you to even
Blink an eye

Well I'll be miles and miles and mile and miles

Introductions don't happen when you walk in the room
Cause by then people all have first impressions on you
From what they've heard
From what their friends have said
They're all opinionated
Thoughts locked in their head
You move in and they're all already on to you
Your awkward smile reassures the boys you've seen them move
Their huddle forms
Their game plans set
The pack become competitors and you're the one they're out to get

[Verse 2]

One by one you write them off cause you have found their floors
That ones a smack-head and the other's scared of the dance floor
Theres that one who sits waiting for his chance
When you've had a couple glasses (Just wait till the hour passes)
Intoxicated your thought process it gets messed up
Next boy's in play seems like he will be the lucky one
Effortlessly he moves over and takes your hand
Finds you a place to talk
Somewhere you can still hear the band
[Bridge]

He says
(What's your name then?)
That you know
(Heard you'll do this)
Well I won't
Is that what you think of me?
(Thought you did this)
Well I didn't

Nah Im skint
But if i had a pound for every-time I've heard this

Her breath has raised a storm and that
Twisted my heart around the air so I had to fall
With the wink of an eye she sets an earthquake in me
My heart rolled down the fissure so I had to fall

But there is something so dangerous about her

Chorus:
She makes me feel like I’m floating
She’s some sort of gravity
She pulls me down but I just see, that she

She makes me feel like I’m weightless
But my lips just kissed the ground
She made me fall just to let me down

Verse 2:
Her smile just hit me like a wave
Washed my heart tot he falls so I had to fall
Her class is tempting like fire
When your heart starts to ignite then you’re about to fall in love
And that’s the thing that’s so dangerous about her

I guess that I'm just so easily led astray

To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

[Verse 2]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
[Chorus]
But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?

[Outro]
I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me, I will set my soul on fire
What have I become? I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em
I'll tell 'em, please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry",84972,en,en,en

Bumped into an old friend, who I hadn’t seen since…

But the days move slow
And the kids grow up
As we all grow old
But I can’t complain
Yeah I been all right
Livin’ the good life
It’s the good life

Ordered up another and we threw ‘em back down
Then I asked about his brother who I used to hang around
Said he sold his old Camaro and he never plays his drums
Now he’s got a little girl out in California

No matter what we find
It all works itself out in due time
Well they’re closing up shop, yeah it’s time to go
So I tell him that I’ll call him, but I think we both know

Ask for love if it just rolls by?""

Please tell me five things that made you stay
Then tell me five of your greatest mistakes
I'm feeling doubtful
And I need new faith
That only a mother could give me
That only a daughter could take

At first you lie
It's become second nature
To protect me from horrible truths that would make you seem
Weak and afraid
But I know about the sacrifice you've made
You say ""Darling it's late
My mind's become useless
I'm old and I'm tired, and all of this talking
Is beyond most
You'll learn for yourself how life goes""

I'll give you one scene I hold to this day
Your father held my hand
He said, ""I know we're not perfect, but I love you
I love you anyway
Yeah, I love you
I love you anyway, yeah""

Just Couldnt Say,rock,Tim Staffell,2003,11,"{""Snowy White""}","It was rainin’ all over the city
Caught  her comin’ out the beauty shop
She  took off in a ‘65 Mustang
Even though I yelled out: “Stop, please, stop!”

She was wearin’ a white tuxedo
She  musta thought she looked real cool
She  drove on out to the east side
And I followed on like a fool

I  ran a red light to get closer
I kept smellin’ gasoline
And two blocks down from City Hall
I nearly lost her, you know what I mean

I  swung round on a quarter
I musta clipped a yellow cab
I could hear someone shoutin’ behind me
They sure thought I was mad

I’m not given to dreamin’
But this was like a special day
The city slipped behind us
What I was doin’ I just couldn’t say
Well, I knew I was losing pressure
When I got on the Interstate
I couldn’t afford to get too far behind
So I floored the gas, ‘cause I could not wait

She was headin’ for Amarillo
The Mustang was throwin’ up spray
Out of the night came an eighteen wheeler
And she didn’t get out of the way

Well, the car went over the Oakie Bridge
I could hear the motor whine
Lit up the sky like the 4th of July
And the Big Mac followed, a wheel at a time

I was still staring into the distance
Long after the fire trucks had gone
She never knew I was watchin’
And I never knew what was wrong

I can’t understand what’d made her
Take off in the night that way
Maybe a secret rendezvous
Or somethin’ else, I just couldn’t say

The Buick was dead by the roadside
Musta driven it into the ground
I walked back, took an hour or so
Couldn’t figure what was goin’ down
The sun was above the horizon
When I let myself in through the door
She was standing with her back to me
And the white tuxedo was on the floor

Seems she was thrown in the river
Looks like she got away
I never asked where she was headed
And you know she just didn’t say",4760644,en,en,en

Raise flares to the dwellings of equivocation
May impermanence temper your suffering

And your pointed fear of a textbook senescence

Waning baleful in the attics of decline

Bound helpless by the tethers of duress

I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll
No pretty chick is going to make me crawl

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know you're riding with the king?

He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
He's going to check us all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody, everybody clap your hands
And don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings
Don't you know you're riding with the king?
Riding with the king
Don't you know you're riding with the king?
A tuxedo and a shiny 335
You can see it in his face, the blues never lie
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
And don't you know we're riding with the king?

I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm going to play this thing until the day I die

Taming the Dragon,rock,Brad Mehldau and Mark Guiliana,2014,2348,{},"[Narration by Brad Melhdau]
Verse 1:
I had this trippy dream were this cat was driving me around in an old convertible the whole time around L.A. Later on it turned into a VW van and near the end it was more like this spaceship kind of thing, and were high up looking over the road, but the front console was shaped like a van and it still had the convertible top. The guy who was driving me around was an older dude - an old hipster with a scratchy voice kind of like Joe Walsh sings, but he kind of had some of that vibe and energy of Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider. Yeah, like if you can imagine a cross between Joe Walsh and Dennis Hopper - that's the dude who was driving me

Verse 2:
We were heading due north on the PCH, coming up to the big stoplight where Sunset Boulevard ends, and were gonna head out past there toward Malibu, maybe circle up through Topanga Canyon and come back through the valley. The light was beautiful in the dream, with all that nice washed-out orange from the pollution. So I had this happy feeling in my stomach but also like this scared feeling like something gonna happen but I didn't know what. Anyhow, as we approaching the light at Sunset, all of a sudden this cat in a sports car came out of nowhere and just cut us off. My man slammed on the brakes and narrowly averted a mash-up. It got my blood boiling, but you know, I wasn't the one driving

Verse 3:
Yeah, so wouldn't you know it, we pulled right up behind that motherfucker at the light and there he was glaring at us through his rear view; he was all like 'Yeah that's right I cut you off, what are you going to do about it?'. So I said to Joe Walsh-slash-Dennis Hopper - I'll just call him Joe now - so I said to Joe ''Man, aren't you gonna say some shit to that douchebag?''. I was all puffed up and pissed off, but I was sitting in the passenger seat. So Joe was quiet and looked straight ahead and said ''You know, man, the only way I'm gonna put some shit out there like that is if I'm ready to dance with that cat. You know what I mean? 'All you've got are your actions, man - and don't forget, your words are you actions too. You put something out there, there's consequences, you know? You wanna dance with that dude?""

Verse 4:
You know, now I realize that Joe was driving me around everywhere and it's like I wasn't even thanking him. I realize that at first I thought he was kind of wild and a bad influence on me, like from my party days, but actually the whole time he kind of like driving me around and taking care of me, watching my back, like the crazy dude in the small car, like how he actually handled that while thing real noble and didn't get all ruffled. He was talking me down from something. I only realized that when I woke up

Verse 5:
It's funny how sometimes with dreams you don't realize who's your friend until after you wake up. Then when you wake up you get this clarity and you see that maybe all these different people were you in the dream and that they're there to lead you to either good or trouble. And the person who's actually acting as you in the dream is kind of like this blind idiot who's just barreling through the whole dream, like I was, trying to be all tough and shit, telling old Joe to go start something with that punk in the sports car

Yeah, but maybe like that crazy dude in the other car was me as well - all those people are just composite of my own shit, all the different parts of me - like you've got this one part of you that watches out for you and keeps you steady, you've got this other part that's raging and full of anger, and those two are vying for your attention, like old Joe and the crazy dude in the dream, and then there's just you and you're listening to both of those voices. But they're all a part of you
You know, I think of it like taming a dragon. The dragon is the crazy dude and if you don't watch out he'll bite your ass hard. So you need old Joe there to set you straight. But Joe knows about the dragon, because Joe and the dragon are a part of you. So don't try to kill the dragon - you know, the dragon's where you get all that voodoo shit from, that's where you get your power from. You don't want to snuff him out, you wanna tame him, you wanna actually make friends with him and harness his power so you can use it...",2888372,en,en,en

In silence of human tears

His lifeline is erased, his destiny is not written in stars any more, his thread of fate is cut off

How worm gave birth to the worm and strange life forms rose from the dust
How wretched useless pieces of flesh, maggots progenies, bred and devour

For the end of the century of crawling human dirt
On the face of the sublunary world
For bringing the offering of their flesh cover in hour

That was ruined and desolated
They gather preserves from the bushes
Consuming the root of diseased trees
Exiled from their heritage
Ostracized like thiefs

Dwelling on creviced cliffs
In holes in the ground
From thickets they cry out
Intetwined amongst thorns

Cast far away
Mocking hymns
I've become an object of scorn
They detest me
Far away from me they stand
With spit they cover my face

Barriers of destruction are in my path
There's no one to stop them
Did someone breach the wall
Terror overwhelms me
My dignity is driven away like the wind
My life recedes from me
Held by days of affliction
The gnawing pain never stops
The collar of my garment chokes me
Reduced to dust and ashes
I cry for help but there is no answer

Tossed about in the storm
Have I not wept for others during hard times
Have I not grieved

Autumn Girl,rock,The Mason Green Experience,2020,31,"{""Blake foster"",""Nicholas Freeman""}","It was a sunny day in mid-September when I first met you
At the time I was unaware of what you were going through
But I could tell I’d finally met somebody truly rare
You could help me find myself, you were someone who cared

On days like this in Minnesota you can see the leaves
Slowly changing color, slowly falling off the trees
And just like people, no two are alike, each one’s a work of art
Men might look at the outside, but God sees our hearts

Autumn girl (4X)
You brought the sunlight to my eyes and color to my world

At school thе kids are shallow and they always act so cruel
And thеre was nothing I could do, I felt like such a fool
No one deserves to hear “you’re just not one of us” all day
I can’t believe that human beings can act this way

See I’d been taught that prejudice was only in the past
But I was wrong, “what year is this?” is what it made me ask
When everyone at school is white except for five or six
It isn’t always nice how they react to someone mixed
Autumn girl (4X)
You brought the sunlight to my eyes and color to my world

Now in those days I was alone and I had special needs
But you could see right past all that and help me to succeed
When I said that I had no friends, you told me I was wrong
You said you were my friend, and that is why I wrote this song

I will remember that September, I will not forget
How much you’ll always mean to me, and I still love you yet
Always know that you are awesome, know this through it all
I’ll think of you each time the leaves change in the fall

You brought the sunlight to my eyes and color to my world

Dark Faith,rock,MONDY MFZB,2019,17,{},"So you say you love me why can't you tell the truth? 
Yeah this rain above me, it really sets the mood. 
And I try so hard to take your lies apart but they don't quite discard the fucking timeless scars that you left for me. 
And I don't even know how you can breathe
When all you know is to deceive
So ima let this go into the sea
Along with my faith. 

So you say you love me but then when we start to date
You dump me the next day cause you just want my heart to break. Thеn next time you say you love mе it's hard to think. You're being honest cause by the time you call it's far too late. 
You can't love one man and flirt with other guys. You either want me or you don't so hurry and decide cause I'm sick of all the lies they're a waste of my time. How can you ever make me yours when you can't stay mine
Everytime you say you love me it's sad to see. Cause you always play me then you come right back to me. Thinking I enjoy you deceiving me happily. Actually it makes my heart ache rapidly to get back together I deserve someone better. Who didn't have commitment issues when I met her. Wish I could forget her but I let her deceive me again does she even need me? 

So you say you love me why can't you tell the truth
Your weakness disgusts me I've never met a person who
Couldn't learn how to trust me after all I did for you
Your heart must be rusty cause I've never seen it used by you. 

Chorus

Cause when it comes to her I feel like giving up and when it comes to me she just don't give a fuck. 
(Cause when it comes to her I feel like giving up and when it comes to me she just don't give a fuck)

Told you it's a must that my heart don't crush you might as well marry lust since you love it so much. And I got nothing on lust but stop false advertising. Say you love someone check the balls that your grinding. Before you continue to lead them on, not like you'd ever care if you treat them wrong but who deserves to go through the same mistakes you made with me? I don't have faith that you would ever change for me. ",6152294,en,en,en

That I don't want to see another... day!

Occupied to go out walking with a friend
And the knowing ain't the need to mend

Step aside

Against the end
Because there is no end

Alone and slacking

And then comes love

You ever love someone so much
You thought your little heart was gonna break in two?

You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your lover back to you?

You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch me walk away?

Value
Everything

When my memories
Idled in distance
Longing for a new melody
Lamenting my thoughts
Yet to be embraced
Obscure the vision they are

Undoubtedly
Missing a small piece
A chance I have almost passed
Regain value
Refining my shape
You‘re now with me so

Make
Me taste what gives us colors
Endless spectrum
Like contrast carries beauty
Unlike the colourblind I'm addicted to grey
I'm in love with monochrome
You see the play of color
See it shatter away into the night
And where old roads are forgotten
New horizons revealed to you instead
Under a foreign flag

Life is a journey
Detours are part of the road
Disregarding all our knowledge

Life is a journey
Branching with maybes
Like a tree
So cherish the absence of color

See it shatter away into the night

Cries silent just the same

And end over your head, don't make me gun butt it
Do you like Manolo, put two in your stomach
And flash the burner on bitches like stacks of hundreds
I'm livin my life (my life), what gets better than ice in hell
When you cookin up coke to sell
It be the little statistics, some pictures, some prints
Some informants to get the operation pitched
We enormous, some would say the ""Inc."" is ""Murderous""
You don't want us to strap up and bang the strip
But if need be, we'll bang out like Bloods and Crips
Styrofoam the noozles and extend the clips
Murder meets gangsta shit

And I will nibble your ear

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

And so I drew a new face and I laughed

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

What's up, you guys
We're ""All Time Low""
Thank you guys very much for being here
This is of course, our 'Unplugged' special on MTV
And we're gonna start you off with a new song
It's called ""Damned If I Do Ya (Damned If I Don't)""

[Verse 1]
I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, fixed up all my broken things
But you left me; Police-tape, chalk-line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
[Verse 2]
It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You're made up, dressed up, messed up plans I set in stone
But you made me do when I don't, like
Dancing in the alley with the street-rat night-life
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up everything for you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

[Bridge]
Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone, I'm a match that's burning out
Could have been, should have done what I said I was going to do
But I never promised you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
It never took a fool to see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I do ya
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me, I think that I should go
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I d-d-d
Damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

Thank you",4532169,en,en,en

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on

All hurting to know the value of a life, value of a life
Some get sorry, the young get old

Say goodbye to the world you dragged across the floor, dragged across the floor

Come round to bruise me up a little bit more
Come round to bruise me up just a little bit more
One day, I’m gonna light like a season of green
My heart is gonna run like a flying machine
Lipstick and a nickel in the pocket of my coat

Remain calmest and abolish your modesty

You show the world that you’re not to mess with

You can expect to get rejected
Neglected, stripped naked, and tested until they reckon
You feel terrible because nothing is comparable
Violence ain’t the answer but the pain is unbearable
You’re nice and jaded from being isolated
Now you coast through life feeling twice as hated
So why the abuse?

White haired angel from second circle of virtues choir
He was obtained by missions and knowledge about future events
And was teaching a magic, knowledge and wisdom from around the world
For that he was exiled and cursed
For that he is lost and forgotten
Imprisoned by Salomon in huge brass pot
Put to the bottom of deep lake with wiliness set himself free
As a prince of hells he orders a thirty one legions of ghosts
He is straight under the Lucifer's dominion
He stands on his fist and holds a great goshawk
Who, as a scout, can see everything
Can order a deserters on a battlefield
Whose attack shatters the enemies

Orders a destructive earthquakes

A DJ bakkle shouldn't get too physical
How you wan talk bout you style so original

Could list off your ripoffs in order categorical
Ya ridims, style and lyrics just copy from historical
But through me nah no pirate seh me so irresistable
And through me versatile Jah know me style so radical
Step tp the inimitable, the damage would be terrible
Sometimes I drop it literal, and other times in parable
Scientific fact is for every little act
There is an equal and opposite reaction

So when you kick a detraction and the bakkle in swing
I just siddung on top of the riddim like the king in a de ring
Whether live chanting or pon a recording

Turn around, concern yourself with your own business

With griefull past

Taste the sorrow, before the dawn

The seagull fly in circles
Over an open sea
A morning again has risen
With silver tears
At the shore of a dreadful baltic
I touch the stones as the water
Echoes your name
Here I stand all alone
Themendous pain freeze inside
The sun sets slowly
Cold and silent

In a void where candles burn

Like our acts of hate - which will never fade
Inside our memory like a secret haze
On the day we die - sins evade from inside
Never to fade - impossible to erase
It sounds like irony - ""we all are free""
Captured by our past eternally
Those to me are fools - ""who try to change""
The facts of history
That's why we feel - sadness...madness
So many tears we shed - a lake of tears
To wash the sins away - but they never disappear
Memories always coming through
Life does not forget the truth
Our ancestors accused - same us our children
They point their fingers at us (it's us) you were killing
Time is running out - to correct the direction
Is there only sadness left or time - for correction?
A possibility - ""that we are free""
To change fate with fantasy
We can make the rules ""change the lanes""
Away from hate - away from hate
Away from sadness...madness...",1753306,en,en,en
Were All Falling Apart,pop,OCTAVIO the Dweeb,2021,187,{},"[Verse 1]
If you need a new safe place, you could fall into my arms
Fight your battles every day, I'll take all the scars

Looking for the sky, I just hit rock bottom
Only gets better from here, I'm switching gears
Watch all the pain disappear
Let go of the wheel, I'ma see where it steers
Hope it steers clear of the bad days
I'm a good man in a bad phase
Got a bad case of the Mondays
But I'ma take it far in my guitar
Put money in the jar
I'll probably crash the car 'cause life is hard
So don't hand me the keys, I gotta go

I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand
Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
Haul on the bowline,"" we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they are far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons

Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line, saying, ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again

Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to ship

Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past
They asked me my name, and I said, ""Captain Kidd""

If You Ask Me I Wont Say No,pop,Pete Shelley,1983,584,{},"I can't sleep my dreams are dreamless
Something's going on between us
I'm too nervous though to make the first move
All I need is your attention
Love's so very hard to mention
Especially when we're just supposed to be friends
You look to me like you've got all the answers
Here's something else you should know

If you ask me I won't say no

Small talk always sounds familiar
If I make a pass won't you will you
I couldn't stand to have to start over again
I react to your reaction
I'm attracted by your attraction
Can't see why we cannot be lovers as friends
I'm not saying that I've got all the answers
But I can tell you this though
If you ask me I won't say no
If you ask me I won't say no
I'm not being backward coming forward
Just sideway's my style
Instead of me just inching closer
Won't you give me a sign

The cause of my misaprehension's
My deep seated fear of rejection
Help me to express the affection I feel

I'm not being backward coming forward
Just sideway's my style
Instead of me just inching closer
Won't you give me a sign

And what's the point in me pretending
That I don't mind
You need only to ask me the question

Exiles,pop,Cruachan,2002,41,{},"(Music: KF, JF Words: KF)

Loneliness was all she knew
Because of her God sent beauty
Evil and carnage were sure to ensure
Her death was Conchobars duty
The high king Conchobar would not dare
So he did her away from his people
Deirdre will live and grow up fair
Then marry me in my temple

(18 yrs. Later)
She was disgusted by Conchobar
And vowed she would not be wed
I love only the man who bears the colours-
Black white and blood red
I know such man!,her aide explained
But Deirdre could only hope
Uisneach's sons were led to the forest
With Naoise, she would elope
No place was safe for the four exiles
They left Eireann with heavy hearts
But to see her face and see her smile
Gave the brothers strength to depart
In Albas' hills they made their home
And began a simple life
Local hatred had suddenly grown
Men wanted her as a wife

Conchobar dreamed of Deirdre his true love
He longed for the touch of her skin
His duties neglected, his life so affected
Why did she leave the court of the King?
After some time he explained he was wrong
Or so we were led to believe
This sorrowful song I have sung for too long
Naoise agus Deirdre I now forgive

Naoise always longed to go back home
When he heard the news he wept
The brothers prepared for the journey ahead
With Fergus Mac Roth they all left
The exiles returned to the King alone
And knew there was something not right
Conchobar made his plans be known
The brothers took up the fight
The exiles fled to the sorrowful forest
Foloowed by the king's men
Deirdre was hidden but they needed rest
They could not fight again
Naoise smelt death and he quietly said-
Please Deirdre stay where you are
A belt of a sword and the brothers fell dead
Deirdre smelt blood on the air

(Conchobar:)
Cannot you see, I did this for you
Our wedding can now take place
They left for Fern Mag, as the cold wind blew
In a chariot she felt deaths embrace
I am Deirdre, for a short time alive
To end life be evil, 'tis worse to survive
From the chariot she fell to her death
To be with Naoise, to smell his sweet breath",1256812,en,en,en

Why should I play this game of pretend?
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend
Oh, don't the tears just pour?

I could curl up and hide in my room
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me, tell me what for

Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight

I gave you the world, you threw it away
Leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem

Within these words, I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight

Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie

And that my world has gone dark without your light?

I will sing no requiem
Tonight
'Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep
No one lights a candle to remember
No, no one mourns at all
When they lay them down to sleep

So, don't tell me that I didn't have it right
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white
After all you put me through
Don't say it wasn't true
That you were not the monster
That I knew

Thinking we werе ready for the tough times wе're ready for nothing

Do you have another cross on you?
Are you close enough yet to see me through?

Oh I will stop it going

I could kill the day just to make the night go on

When I'm weary, alone and forsaken
He lifts me up, He is so real

Where danger waits, I may go on
My Master looks then until He finds me
He'll kindly backed him to the fold

Undercover to cover
A book of perfect matches
The smoked out lovers
Nicotine patches

The smell of fresh tar
A road crew’s fire
A swan vesta eyes
A police car named desire

[Pre-Chorus]
Though that we were getting on just famously
Just a drag for you, it’s the pack for me

Ooh, you don’t ease my pain
You’re cruel
Ooh, you don’t ease my pain
You’re cruel

Over counter to counter
And don’t you feel better
A sick note cherished
More like a love letter

Come on codeine
No mojo, no hunger
Remember how I used to be
A sexy midnight runner

Never can get it up, so I just get down
Take a little white pill, it’ll see me around

No decency, just cruelty

So every midnight I return to my heavenly father
I realized nobody knows you when you hit the bottom
They give you 30 but soon as she come around I got em

I never cried myself to sleep, I stayed and took the pain
Real shit, fuck niggas with they fakin ass
And fuck bitches in the dark, they so a shakin ass
It’s hoe it now but I know one day all this shit will pass

Stuck in the cell, was hard to hide this hidden pain

Embraced in a circle

The one takes the place of the other
Returning continuously in the beginning

Has now become its integral part

From the marvelous world of the unknown
Is hidden deep
Imprisoned from the seeweeds
Ornamented with the flowers of the sea

Every creation is also a piece
Of its creator

Tied in knots of skin and bone
And looking for an exit door again
I swear I've seen this before
Looking sideways out of a dream
Some here, some gone
And now somewhere inbetween
Inbetween, inbetween, inbetween...

Strangulate my memory
But there ain't much I'm able to recall
These faded yellow photographs
Splintered and scattered on the floor

Well there once was a right and a wrong
And there once was an easy way out
But the lines that were drawn
Have dissolved in a furnace of sound
Of sound... Of sound... Of sound....
The grinding teeth and flapping jaws
Of cold and bloodless faces in the crowd
Now coming on as white as noise
You double forward into here and now

And we'll get to know our guts
If we have to tear them out
And then pound our fists into bloody pulps on the ground
We'll pound our fists on the ground

In suspended animation
Neither live nor dead

Living in limbo ain't cheap",1611255,en,en,en

Just what I should say
To someone who's guts I couldn't stand
One more day
And then it hit me like a bolt out of the blue

I know that you think
I'm the worst
Person that you've
Ever been cursed
To meet
And I know that you
Probably wish
I were pushing daisies
Through a ditch
But I've changed my tune
Walking along I wondered
Just who I knew
With enough pent up anger to beat someone
Black and blue
Then it came to me like a light bulb overhead
I know that you want at least one person dead
I went abroad for awhile
Learned how to say please
And say thank you
Fell in with a kindly old yogi
He had lots of good things to show me
I feel that I'm almost enlightened
Still I want to bash this guy's head in
I thought maybe you could arrange it
'Cause my new state won't allow it
Now
Lying around I wondered just who I could get
To help me have this big jerk that I know knee-capped
And then it hit me exactly like a lightning strike
You're full of rage and probably spoiling for a fight
I know that you think
I'm the worst
Person that you've
Ever been cursed
To meet
And I know that you
Probably wish
I were pushing daisies
Through a ditch
But I've changed my tune
Strolling along I wondered just how to ask
If you'd consider maybe kicking that dude's ass
I think I know what would make it real easy
You could pretend that that dude's ass is me
Sorry I ran over your pet cat
Sorrier still I laughed so hard like that
Sorry that my old drug connection
Busted up your Hummel collection
Sorry I showed up at your old job
Sorrier still I brought an angry mob
Sorry about your tires and my razor

Both I burn straight through

Just a little too soon

Or a calendar year
It can last a long time
Or it can just simply dissapear

I'm going down

And into the mud

What About the Bond,pop,Bruce Cockburn,1980,131,{},"[Verse 1]
Disharmony
Gives way to mute helplessness
Not enough communication
Too much not expressed
It's all too easy
To let go of hope
To think there's nothing worth saving
And let it all go up in smoke

What about the the bond? (What about the bond?)
What about the mystical unity?
What about the bond (What about the bond)
Sealed in the loving presence of the Father?

Dysfunction
Of the institutions
That should give a frame to work in
Got to find our own solutions
Confusion
Pressure from all sides
Got to head right down the centre
In the love that will abide

What about the bond (What about the bond)
Sealed in the loving presence of the Father?

Man and a woman
Made to be one flesh
Nobody said it would be easy
But can we let go now and fail the test?

Life is full of moving on
But do you want the pain that's already been spent
To all be wasted? Come on!

And their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny

And a bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered through the sky
He saw some riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry

As they galloped past him
He heard one call his name

John Doe No. 24 Live - One Night Lonely,country,Mary Chapin Carpenter,2021,16,{},"[Verse 1]
I was standing on the sidewalk in 1945
In Jacksonville, Illinois
When asked what my name was there came no reply
They said I was a deaf and sightless half-wit boy
But Louis was my name, though I could not say it
I was born and raised in New Orleans
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it
On a barge and a prayer upstream
Well, they searched for mother
And they searched for father
And they searched till they searched no more
And the doctors put to rest their scientific tests
And they named me 'John Doe No. 24'
And they all shook their heads in pity
For a world so silent and dark
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery
But so too is the human heart
And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crepe jasmine bloomed on St. Charles Avenue
Though I couldn't hear the bells
Of the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew
And if I were an old man returning
With my satchel and porkpie hat
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon
And I'd hit everyone on Basin after that
[Verse 2]
Well, the years kept passing as they passed me around
From one state ward to another
Like I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found
Always missing the other
And they gave me a harp last Christmas
And all the nurses took a dance
Well, lately I've been growing listless
I've been dreaming again of the past
I'm wandering down to the banks
Of the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand
I am seven years old and I feel my daddy
Let go of my hand
While I drew breath no one missed me
So they won't on the day that I cease
Put a sprig of crepe jasmine with me
To remind me of New Orleans

Patches,country,George Jones & B.B. King,1994,2778,{},"[Intro]
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
Why I was so ragged folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
But deep down inside dad was hurtin'
'Cause he done the best he could

[Verse 1]
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
Education that he never had
But he did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops we raised
Barely paid the bills we made

[Verse 2]
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Placed his hands on my shoulder and with tears he said
[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Verse 4]
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See I was the oldest of the family
And everybody was depending on me

[Verse 5]
Now here's the path that everybody's on
Mamas been living in a brand new home
Lord, knows it took a lot of sweat and tears
And my daddy's blood to help us through the teas

[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Interlude]
Daddy had been sick for a long time, flat on his back
Every evening after we'd finished our chores and eat our dinner
We'd all go into papa's room to cheer him up a little
And this particular day, Dad was in good spirits
Sitting on his side of the bed telling mama how good she looked
When all of a sudden papa had a pain in his chest
I was too young to understand, talking about a heart attack here
Mama rushed all of us out of the room into the hallway
About ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes
She called out to me, ""Patches, patches get in here boy
You're daddy want to see you.""
I went running to papa's room, there papa lay
Daddy had tears in his eyes, I knew something was wrong
'Cause daddy was a poor man but all of his life he'd been a proud man
I knelt down on one knee beside the bed, papa put his hand on my shoulder
He said, ""Patches, Patches boy, the hammer of life done beat
Your old papa down to the ground and I ain't got nobody
To turn to to take care of mama and the young ones.""
""So, what I want you to do is promise me son
Is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama
As much as you can, I said, ""Papa, I'm gonna do my best.""
But little did I know then like I know right now
That trying to climb life's mountain
Searching for a top when there ain't no top
Sometimes you find yourself frustrated, lazy
But every time I feel like I can't live my life like I want to
My mind goes back to the day when I see those tears in my daddy's eyes
But most of all I remember his words
""Patches, I'm depending on you boy.""
Every time I feel like giving up I hear his voice
""Patches, Patches, Patches, Patches.""
[Verse 6]
""I'm depending on you son
I tried to do me best, it's up to you to do the rest.""
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best, it up to you to do the rest.""

She said, ""hey baby, are you done yet?
Are you gonna work all day?""

She turned and asked if I needed anything

But foolin' 'round is certainally not my game

The cowboy drank his beer and took her home
Lust on his mind
In a bedroom he had her all alone
And when the night was over
The cowboy shook his head
'Cause she slept on the sofa
And the cowboy slept alone on his bed

She still sees the cowboy
On the country shows and sometimes on T.V
He phones her up and talks to her long distance
From wherever he might be
He'll ask her how she's doin'

Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland

We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good

Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book

But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

Fair as the sweetest flower bloomin' in the shade
She loved a bandit bold who roamed the prairie o'er
And every night she'd listen for his call
Then far the west his voice came ringing ridin' wild horse he came singing
Hee li oli yip ioli ay
Hee li oli yip ioli yip ay oli ya he brings a token of his love
Swift as the wind he goes for high as the hills he knows she's waiting
For his hee li oli yip ioli ay

One day he rode away but never to return
Danger was waitin' now his love must never yearn
Long days and lonely nights she waited all in vain
Till winter passed and summer came again
Still every night when the moon came shining for his song her heart was pining
Hee li oli yip ioli ay
Hee li oli yip ioli...

One night an angel brought a message from her love
Told her he waited in the starry sky above
Softly she closed her eyes and bade the angel go
And then the whole world echoed to his song
For straight down a moonbeam he came ridin' out of the sky on a winged horse glidin' Hee li oli yip ioli ay

While a funeral train of cars drove by with their lights on
It was just my luck, it went on and on for miles

Then suddenly it dawned on me that whoever this is
Is going to be missed for a long, long time
It got me thinking

200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived
And I hope I leave half as much love behind when it's my time

So I followed that last car down to the church
Took off my ball cap, tucked in my shirt
I just had to see what kind of life could cause such as traffic jam

There's a lot of good souls made better for knowing him
And now I'm one of them

Hey girl don't worry 'bout him
I'm sure he's a gentleman
But even the good ones they'll forget
The unwritten rules of a relationship
And when they do well they're ain't no worry
Love birds, deserve love birds

A doghouse says no vacancy sign
Don't overthink or overanalyze
And naturally let 'em fly
Put a feather in the wind and let it do the work
Love birds deserve love birds

When you've had enough throw the finger up
A little twiddle in the middle
Then kiss and make up

Gets the point across like a loaded gun
Don't have to wonder
Don't have to guess
The moral of the story is
One in the hand is two bushes worth
Love bird deserve love birds

A little twiddle in the middle
Then kiss and make up

But we just have to roll it and kick it with a smile
Lately we've been through alot of shit but
This is MBL CLAN forever yeah let's go let's fuck it up

I just wanna go and make my momma proud
Then I look up to the sky then to clouds One day I'm gonna perform in big crowds
But every time I try nd rap they say I'm to loud
Momma always said that I got to work hard
Then I'll make it big then I'll travel all abroad
I gat to hustle everyday so I can go eat
But Momma always said hustle like you you from the streets

I got help myself I need therapy
That's why I write good music and melodies
Get away from bad haters and memories
I wanna live long till I am seventy
Grow with a cute girl named Emily
And we Gon live long and share memories
Maybe do a few crimes and  felonies
But still my race remains heavenly
Life is so short so I'm living mine day by day
The streets ain't nice so I pray to God yh I pray
The streets are real nice but sometimes it's just hell
The police hate us so they  throw us in cells  keep sinning just keep on winning
But my hustle is just starting so i guess it's the beginning
You wanna make money don't use the way of killing
Don't throw your life away it really have no meaning
6 years finally done now it's time to go and start a new chapter
Thank you for all the memories all the good tears and laughter
I'm gonna be a boss in the future rich nigga shit imma be a Rapstar

When I write them songs I feel like Shakespeare
Everything I said seemed crystal clear
Though that shit was fast like a reindeer
When you play my songs, I bet you smirk
From “take you down” to “back in the days”
“69 pockets” was everyone’s fav
“Gang blues” came from the back of my brain
“25 strokes” was just for play
“Good vibes” first one in the studio
Damn my nigga we went cold feet
Now we all gone so hard in the game

BOB Bob Gee, Young nigga so wise, young nigga so amazing

Hop in back and I’ll bring in the money, this bill is so large that it got my heart racing

Gave her the bread and I gave her the butter

Gave her the love and I gave her the dollar

Gave her the bitch and I gave her the stopper

I gave her the bitch and I gave her the stopper

The stopper

I’m hanging with dullards

I’m hanging choppers

Was to lose myself and to shun desire
I thought I had
Life figured out

But I, (oh) I am different now

And all the little ways that I tried to rebel
Well, I kept them quiet
Hid them well
Because it wasn't real if it was never found

And I looked at the world
Through the eyes of a mask
And compared myself with some fuzzy math
To stake my claim on higher ground
Oh I, (oh) I am different now
Oh I, I am different now

And I felt the holy water as a kid
But still the love of God felt like a stranger
Had to live and die to become born again
Baptized in the fire of all my failure

Still have the flaws like I always did
A capacity for violence that I'm asking God to take away
But I can look the world in the eye and make my amends with an honest life

Sweet Shadow Man,country,Lavender Country,2022,54,{},"Behind a Louisiana juke, nineteen sixty-two
When we all knew where the Jim Crow flew
And sodomy was a huge taboo
I came creeping to you

You had a downcast eye on the back of the bus
When we was on the down low hush
But the midnight moon made my hot blood gush
When I came creeping to you
When I came creeping to you

Oh, sweet shadow man, nap nap nappy hair
Oh, sweet shadow man, meet you in the weeds, I swear
On Saturday night when the sun went down
I was laying on my back and bare
On Sunday morning when the sun came up
I was a white Baptist in prayer

Lunch counter for me, lunch counter for you
Fountain for whites and another one too
But it came to nothing after we got through
When I came creeping to you
Can't you hear mama weep and wail?
Daddy's shotgun's got rock salt and nails
He'd shoot me dead and he'd shoot me too
If he knew I was creeping to you
If he knew I was creeping to you

Oh, sweet shadow man setting my loins on fire
Oh, sweet shadow man, fill me with your long thick spire
On Saturday night when the sun went down
I was twitching like a bird on a wire
On Sunday morning when the sun came up
I was a dirty rotten low down liar

A king in England's country fair
In every forest, copse and glen
This king would take his royal share
Neither gentry fine their private lands
Not the common fields in common hands
Could e'er escape his roving eye
Bold Reynard and his kingly tithe

And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

[Verse 2]
His coat of burnished amber made
Did shine like fire atop the hill
To put the golden sun to shame
As o’er his back he slung his kill
Though the huntsman's hounds did him pursue
Both brook and briar and bramble through
He yet retained his liberty
Bold Reynard still is roaming free

And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

No longer have the time nor care
For either forest, copse or glen
Of which Bold Reynard has his share
The city now spreads o’er the land
No common fields for common hands
And Reynard's fate is sore unkind
His kingdom now he leaves behind

And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

So now our king his lands has lost
And swiftly comes his cruel demise
The cold dark streets his only realm
And table scraps his only prize
His fiery mane once royal cloak
Now turning grey with dust and smoke
As now he wanders door to door
And sips the morning dew no more

Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop

Ill Start Believing In You,country,Hank Thompson,2000,5,{},"Tell me how the cow jumped over the moon

How Jack on the beanstalk climbed to the sky

Tell me how Jack Horner got a plumb from his thumb
And how Humpty Dumpty fell

Than all the other stories you tell

You said your diamond ring was just an innocent little thing
That you got it at a Stanley party
Stanley must be quite a guy and his parties sure run high
The price tag read one thousand and forty

Tell me Cinderella did you get your fella
Just by losing your shoe

Like the farmer who lived in the dell
There’s the owl and pussy cat know the one about Jack Sprat

There's the turtle and the hare the preacher and the bear
And the one about the little boy blue

Had your swimsuit and an olive you were eating
Now they don't wear bikinis or hand out martinis

At the Opry on Saturday night
And they're searchin' the bars and the basements
For some souvenir of his life
They're plannin' a book for September
Showin' his plain country roots
Any they're sellin' the rights to the movie
And the Hall of Fame's gettin' his boots

That I wish that I could change

Is what I've done to you and me

If heaven brings, I will step down
It's only the wind knocking me down

Some say that angels were all looking down
My only soul, vultures circling around
With no help from god the shadows I follow
Sometimes the truth is scared of the dark

Well, I dealt my weakness with all of my doubts
And traded my secrets to figure it out
With no help from god forever I roam
Till I found your heart, I was on my own

Well, I felt the alter shake up my bones
And I held your tender kiss for my own
With no help from god, we stood all alone
And followed our hearts and buried the stones

Sometimes my tortures are all I can bear
For so long I've waited for this coast to clear
With no help from god I will stand proud
And here by your side under the clouds",762950,en,en,en

Temporary Nature Of Any Precious Thing,country,Lucinda Williams,2014,553,{},"Afraid to love and afraid to give
Just because of what it might cost us
But love can never, never live

Life's never fair and it can be rough
And it can turn and play cruel tricks on us
And just when we think we've had enough
There's always on more river to cross

That just makes it, just makes it more precious
But not easier, not easier to lose
To lose somebody as precious as you

Why we are made to weather these storms
But God knows I love you
And you've always been precious
Since the day, the day you were born
And it's always the sweetest reddest roses
That kiss the sharpest thorns
And it's always the deepest saddest joys
That prove to be the richest ones

Leaning in the corner

Runs out a figure with his left hand

And I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""

""I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden
At last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T’was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden
The county laid his daddy in the grave""
""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
If that will get my baby out of jail""

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
""I'll go bring your darling baby to your side""
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling
She kissed her baby boy and then she died

""I'm not in your town to stay,""
Said a lady old and gray
""I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail""",1776852,en,en,en
Solar Pilgrim,country,Twain,2017,8528,{},"Walk right by me
I’ll be glad to have you in my life a while
There’s always room for one more

Eat! Drink!
Lay down with the beauties of this earthly world
I think that they want to lay down with you

In the morning
Getting stronger, getting richer by the day
That’s the way that it was meant to be

They won’t tell you
But there was once a time when we all lived that way
That was before the money came raining down on us

Now: my soul is a pilgrim
And my body is barely keeping up
And one day, it won’t keep up any more

And on that day
I’ll go sailing through the clouds (crowds)
Through the stars
On a Solar Highway to my god
But till then
I’m still healthy
Sitting in the morning sun
With no one around to sit down next to me

They all know it
They all know I’ve got that kind of soul and they run away
They all know that kind of soul won’t stay long

Oh my god, come take me
I just cannot wait another day
Oh my god! Come take me away!",3282902,en,en,en

Cause love’s for nothing, and pain is free
Give it away for something; give it away to me
