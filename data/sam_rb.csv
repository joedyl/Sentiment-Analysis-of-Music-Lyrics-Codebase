Too many years of this, too many fears of this
Too many tears on deafened ears 'bout shit that don't exist
This time the difference is, I got this confidence
No longer needing your permission for my self defense

If preservation is what you call ""selfishness""
I'd rather be selfish than be helpless to my helplessness

Come, dear, and don't let our faith weaken
Let's keep our love fires burning bright
Your love for me is heavenly beacon
Guiding me through love's darkest night
Don't start minding or fault finding
No matter how dark one's path may grow
Fate won't hurry, well, don't worry
We'll just keep our hearts aglow

Though skies now are gray
Love like ours can never be ruled

Spending hours looking at the screen but no-one’s calling
Can you tell me what I did
Can you please not shut me out
Please don’t leave me all alone
Tell me what this is about
I don’t know what I did
We were fine all along
Mmm you made me so weak now I struggle to stay strong
When did all this get f***ed up
Tell me where did we go wrong
Now there’s nobody to turn to
All I have is this song

Signs flashing before my eyes
I was focused on the prize
Never noticed all the lies, now it’s all gone
It’s funny if I had a new chance I’d probably play the same song
Still act like there never was a thing wrong
It’s okay, be okay, girl I’ll still let you have it your way
Wrote a whole tape ‘bout the things I’ll say
Before it all falls down
I guess I’ll throw it all away
Was it worth it
Probably not
Better than before because you’re perfect
All them other guys don’t even deserve it

Told you I was the answer and you still circled B

Eliza won't you tell me true
What ever has gone sour in you?
Where is the girl that I once knew?
Eliza, I beg of you
Tell me it isn't true

Sixteen years and several days
I've watched you as you've grown astray
So wild and foul
Unruly, untamed
Not as how you were raised and now you are going away

[Spoken Word Bridge]
Eliza's entire life was packed into a bag that night. Everything unimportant left behind. She'd departed for a place perched high above a glacial plane: The Athеns Asylum for the Clinically Insane. It looked likе some sort of castle or prison from your dreams. The type that wakes you up in the middle of the night with sweat and screams. Eliza's heart sank. She panicked and cried. She begged not to be locked away on the other side. But before she knew it, so suddenly, so quick, the nurse shut the door and it sealed with a click
She sobbed for three years 'til her tear well ran dry. And then she conjured up a plan to make an escape for it that night. So she slipped out the window, past the spring, lover's lane. She was almost home free 'til a search light hit her face

And they dragged her down to the basement

And my honeys be celibate, something that you ain't fuckin' with
I'm on the road I bang, these bitches know my name
If they don't fuck me 'cause the money, it's 'cause I showed the chain
I always been a boss, I never spoke to lames
To them I'm so so deaf nigga, no Jermaine
I'm wit' a bad chick probably got your cash under
And she not Mario but she like to smash brothers

I smack the ass and pull back the rubber, I'm about to smash

[Speaking:]
Hello?
Girl, this trick done lost her damn mind
Who?
My damn roommate from hell

Girl, I know she ain't trippin'
Yes, girl, yes
And my lights are turned off
And I ain't got nuttin' in my refrigerator
But some stank ass milk

[Verse 1: Lamyia]
Ohh, no she didn't
Just go there with it
I told you, girl
This chick was shady
But you didn't get it
So where she at?
You'll find it
Only take a minute
Cause we da fire, we got heat
So you know we'll bring it

[Quierra]
She used to be my best friend
Tighter than most skin
And closer than cousins

But then
Things are different now though
Because I would follow (So I let her move in)

Said she needed a hand
So I have her a chance (To get back on her feet)
Given the circumstances

I don't understand this
How could she play me
Last month..

[Chorus:]
She didn't pay her half of the rent
(Not me)
But still went shoppin' when your paycheck was spent
(Not me)
You said the phone bill wasn't due till the 10th
(Not me)
Ooh oh
Oh no, she didn't
Oh no, she didn't
Oh no, she didn't

You bought the groceries with a bouncing check
(Not me)
You got a man who keeps on calling collect
(Not me)
And do you think that you can disrespect
(Not me)

Ooh oh oh no she didn't
Oh no she didn't
Oh no she didn't

[Verse 2: Quierra]
She's got the nerve to be rude
Breaking up my mood
While eating up all my food

And then she dirties the kitchen
Flirtin' with my man
I had to be like, ""Bitch, listen""
You may think it's a joke
But I ain't goin roll
Trying to pay for us both
Instead of giving me more stress
Handle your mess
Or we'll both be homeless
This month..

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge: Quierra]
Why do you bounce my blouses
Like the whole world owes you something?
What can you expect
If you keep writing checks
And not deposit nothing?

Why do you keep on buying new shoes
Knowing the bills are due?
I don't believe you
How can continue to do me
The way that you do

[Talking]
Yo, that girl is crazy
Hey, but for real
Thought that heifer is bout
To get me straight evicted
She messed up my credit
Now what the hell am I supposed to do?

Yes, girl
Ooh oh
Oh no, she didn't
Oh no, she didn't
Oh no, she didn't

That girl is off the hook for real
If that was me
I would have gotten her moved along time ago
You best believe when
I kick her ass she gonna be gone

Ooh oh
Oh no she didn't
Oh no she didn't
Oh no she didn't

She needs to check herself before she gets left
She needs to give up every cent of her next paycheck
She needs to show a girl a little respect

Hopes up, nineteen on the road then
I could rope in anything that I wanted to

By the time it got here I was over it
I was waiting on the come up–

The dolphins makin' waves, sending moonlight
If I had a chance to make a day
I'd have to make a past one

You never meant to hurt me when being me was a one time thing…

I admit I got pressure that still provides at night
But I leave everything to sow incase the seams breaking
My job is stress and your trust in me is a lead danger
No wonder why I say don't drink but come home mean wasted

I guess it’s cause all my anger's stuck in this chalice
And either your momma loves me or holds me out on occasion
The feeling's still a resemblance to being stuck on probation
Where they watch you from a distance or never care if you’re awake

And all your friends at me All positivity for most but they still at me
I know you do just because I show love really
I always try to go put our difference aside
But I heard you say we cool and not the way that the distance applies

Took my raised from me that's the shit that the distance is tied
True love isn't measured circumstances your distance implied
That you have so much to worry bout but you answer your phone
Telling me your don't check it every now is a cynical lie
Love me Red or Blue And not because I'm indifferent with sides
That just stands for times you're either good or your different at times
Those nights when you're glad you got your one that is there to reside
Or screaming at each other but you still love each other inside

Realizing hopefully that the room here is changing the vibes
You brought me to my red the room where everything's p
Sometimes I wonder if it was you would you feel this ashamed..
But then even when you wrong you point me as the finger to blame…

This ain’t a two way
Back when on your couch we used to listen to your tunes babe
And we’d have discussion over Bryse and our marijuana amusement
For you the sound wasn't the only reason I was tuned in

I remember sitting at the gas station you asked me why I loved you
I chased you for some months and you seem to deny my retail
I get it babe but you don’t have to ask for all the details
Seeing all my friends get the chance to call you
And get you to come over

Smoke a little weed and drink a bit till your not sober
Or ask to teach you Spanish when you know it ain't that kosher
Or stay the same spot and same couch or your bed even
Your wall hit me the hardest that's the reason I can't sleep but
Apparently I’m the dumb and it's done when it's all closure
Cause I apologize for all the things that I didn't know of
And I apologized for all the things that I did know of
There's no fair treatment when the story is done nigga

Fuck all the wedding rings
Fuck all of the love or fuck the hatred I'm setting things
Don't bother me in the club in the future with petty things Cause I'll be living plenty to this life with some ready Tings

You may be ok but I'm not set on our mending things
Machine mystery stories but I”m not set on the meddling things
Let me live my life since you decided to do the same
Without telling me dog but I see things from a mile away

This is probably why this song lives deeply inside of your safe
Sayin I don't know the code but I'm the best when deciphering the case
That's why they read what I say and they leave me on read
It's pretty implicit when I know what'd I'd mean to you dead

Let's dive right in
When I got to browsing
See you from the south end
Got a lot in common
So I slid in DMs
What you do on weekends
Going out with your friends?
Aw blessed I’m in
Showed up with the dogs
Got lost in the fog
Then we hoped
To the spot like leapfrog
Said you like to move slow but now that's off
Should we move upstairs that's your call
Yeah spend a little time with the boy
Get away from the heat and the noise
Fell in love with the tone in my voice
Now we here and there’s only onе choice
And it's on yeah it's on
Don't think too much got me zoning
I just wanna keep you up til thе morning
We just gotta stay right here in the moment
We deep in and I'm floating
[Chorus: Aligo & Marie Dahlstrøm]
Spend a lil time when you got the night off
Got the mood right with your high heels on
So we pour lil wine, take clothes off
Lights go down, spark comes on

If we could spend yeah
A moment or two
I'll show you why
It makes sense with you
If we could spend yeah
A moment or two
I'll show you why
It makes sense with you

[Verse 2: Marie Dahlstrøm]
Oh yeah I got your message
Yeah boy you got potential
I won't have to keep you guessing
If you show me you’re special
I’ve been waiting for a long time
For a man to come around
Thats mine
So just give me a chance
And I hope you got plans for us
Tonight, back at mine
I don't usually move like this
But I like this, and I might just
Give you everything you want
Yeah right on time
Yeah that’s right

Your love is like a see saw, baby, see saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down, and up like a see saw

When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
I thought your love was sincere
But at this rate, it won't last a year

And Tuesday, somethin' I've been missin'

Saturday, the day we break up

396,Hammond Gamble,"We went up, we went down
Like a roller coaster
East and West town to town
Looking for a different world

And High times, wild times
Kinda brought us closer
When I finally hit the ground
I was looking at a different girl

That's her in the photograph
Taking up the other half
The half that isn't here
But still won't disappear
Memory Number 1

I see her everywhere I go
In faces I don't even know
It's always someone else
She's never there herself
Memory number 1
We went up, then went down
In a blaze of glory
East to west town to town
Living in a different world

But time changes everything
Even the story
I always felt so close to her
She was such a different girl

That's her in the photograph
Taking up the other half
The half that isn't here
But still won't disappear

Sick minds, sad sights
Neverending sleepless nights have been accepted as an everyday thing
Wiretapping, kidnapping
(Will the Russians push the button?)
I tell you, people, our thoughts and values have got to change
They say love is the strongest force on this earth
Uh, but to me, peace among people surpasses love in worth
People jobs don`t come no bigger than the one we`ve got to do
If we don`t give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?
(Think about it)
That`s why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend
This unrest between races has got to come to an end
Don`t let the color of my skin confuse you
I swear on a stack of Bibles I won`t misuse you
So put your hand in mine
Huh, we're gonna form a human chain, mightier than a hurricane

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
And walk this land, hand in hand, day and night, black and white
We gotta unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it with me
We got to unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, ahnd in hand, black and white
God almighty, sing it, sing it, sing it
Ah, unite the world
Come on, come on, come on, ah
[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
Oh, ding-dong-ding let the freedom bell ring
The good Lord made you and me, what he wanted us to be
Free all those people you got chained up in your mind
Now there`s truth in what I`m saying
We gotta stop the games we`re playing
Two wrongs ain`t never made a right (Right)
Hung up, tripped out, whatever you may be
Now is the time to set yourself free
Put your hand in mine, huh, come on
Oh, and let`s walk
Oh, we gonna...

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it with me now
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Raise your voices and sing along
Come on, we gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna put an end to this insanity
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
We gonna unite the world
Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
