They tear our fucking heart apart
Our dreams and mistakes
Become our dreams, but fake
How they away with it

Is corrupt as shit
Our entertainment industries
Really must not be too pleased

Maybe even give em a fucking raise
But when they eyebrows start to raise

To find their passion
To follow their dreams
But you cannot dream, when your awake
Everybody just woke up
Models gonna throw up
Homie when you gonna grow up
I froze up
When I realized
That I've getting older
Used to be 7 years old
Now a 15 year old man
I only got one plan
Only got this one life
So I
Felt something was missing
So we started searching
The whole world started turning
My vision started blurring
By the time I came back
Everything was diffrent
Everything has changed man
So much shit was missing
So I went up on a mission
To re-fix the system
That we all call living
That clock just keeps on ticking

Uh, yeah
Time is money, so I try to get the timing
The rap game sunny, peep the sky, its just so blinding
They think you funny when you try to be the one thats rhyming
Its sweet like honey, when I die its gon' taste like the Ramen
Ramen that I used to eat on Tuesdays, fuck what you make
Climbing up the ladder, this is Doomsday, where the crew stay
Signs of pitty patter from the crusade, thats a touché
Lines of ""whats the matter"" from my roommate, nothing to say
As I wake up from my dream, this shit ain't what it seems
A song to take up on thе screen, then you should've just seen
The look that brought up on thе scene, man it wasn't so keen
It shook him up, the certain thing that it wasn't so clean
He was writing lyrics just to make the people hear it
Despite the fearing, it was too fake, didn't put sincere in
And thats the clearance, he's not the one that was made for steering
I fight the spirit, plus I steer it, man I mean this dearest

[Verse 2: XLoRacer]
Pause for a second as I get another weapon to kill these adolescents
And thats just with my deadly presence
I take a gamble on life with a pair of dice for paradise
And since its not making cents, its really hard to pay the price
And then I figured out that there's no second chances
I skipped out on heaven to chill where the devil dances
To only see that that demons that were haunting me was self inflicted pain that was given' to me mentally
So I, started to smoke it away
Thought it was a clear escape and kept telling myself that ""it's okay""
But as these blunts keep getting rolled up
I keep getting shortness of breath and my words get choked up
I might as well not put myself through this abysmal hell
The only thing I want in life is to prevail
To tell my grandchildren all of my greatest tails
About this young hero who achieved his own holy grail

Go head go head go head and jump
Just know there's no net at the bottom,this ain't a stunt
You get more than a bump tryna front on my progress
Im high but not too high to not see the devil in a blue dress
With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity
And I won't see defeat, victory is kicking up yo feet
Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street
I promote change but not the type to act strange
Change to better yourself and do better things

I fall but not too far down
Get up, i gotta swim or I'll drown

That bird wan ring, Mugz don't take the rope and hang
Yourself, too smart, safe guard your heart
Safe guard your heart
[Verse 2: Mugz]
I walked through fire and got burned, what did I learn
That every adult sins and it was just my turn
Ima firm believer in hit your head to keep it up
Cause you was looking down instead of looking up
Hard to see where you going with your eyes closed
You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

[Verse : Mugz]
If only I could fly, but no not I
I sing caged bird blues , drink booze, watch life pass me by
I got money but can't afford happiness what could I buy
Maybe a slice of pie or a piece of mind
Who am I, if I can't touch the Sky, a penguin
I taught I saw a putty cat inside brave men
Hoped ya peeped the quotes, they free but in the same boat
They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

The noose of life struggles will choke you
The hatred and envy of enemies will provoke you
But baby, remember what I told you

In dark he will be your light, in pitch black he will shine bright

I want crew's participation
In the strangulation of a nation
Concentrate and make fire stations die of smoke inhalation
A confrontation with more organization is complication
You better start looking for some new occupation
I slip the Reeboks on my feet and hit the street
You want beef, the top of your physique will hit the concrete
I rap like Iraq and bomb like Saddam
Rock a spot on your block that your clique's clocking on
A lot of little brains and names are flaming out the middle
So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole
I fill up coffins every so often
I wanna go to Heaven but Hell's closer and I hate walking
So M double I.L.K. will represent
The hip hop is hotter than sex inside a leather tent

Stick 'em and pull out the wack wire

So back up and let me move, I got a bloody point to prove
On a violent vibe and ready to groove

Late drives in the night time
White walls with them bright headlights, them headlights

I was ready to sell everything that I had
Just to sit in that car, dreams of driving really far
Driving out to see the sunset and the stars
And the stars always shine so bright
I never wanted to ever see the daylight
Driving coast to coast, love of my life to my right
Wind flowing just right, everything was alright, alright

Nightingale is here
Listen...
Do you really believe in everything you see in Instagram? Oh, shit...
Yeah

[Verse One]
I’ma catch-potato, wanna know how I spend a day?
Surfing Instagram on my Apple phone - no way!
I think in this way I’m visualizing something
But the truth is that I’m simply doing nothing
Pretending being rich and wealthy, blowing flour but still healthy, always draped in something classy, behind the wheel of Maserati, hanging heavy Louie bags hella full with money bands, living in a penthouse which is higher than the clouds
Yeah
That’s my thoughts I’m lying and scrolling the feed
Yeah
I’ve never fought, but despite this I suffer defeat
Yeah
Rap game, for me it is still something new
No refrains in this track
But why, I got no clue
[Bridge]
This story is sad, cause Insta-dreams are fake
I’m getting hella mad, there are some actions to take

[Verse Two]
As an employee I’ve earned some funny money
Yeah
Never invested it, but felt like Axelrod Bobby
Spent a half on my Stans which are white and green
A couple of kickz is worth of fucking routine
My Instagram is opened on pages of business bloggers
Bentleys at the background , they all draped in suits and loafers
Double tap on their pictures the only thing that I do
Instead of building my life I flush the time down the tube
Yeah, ugh

Yo! we win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts
We win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine
[Verse 2: R.H. Bless]
This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword
Hip-Hop's a holocaust, grab ya holy cross, ya crescent and star
Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah
Refer to ya bibles, Qu'ran and Torah
Bless, I be the high exalter, divine curer, who mind is purer
Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze
All those who choose to itemize lies

Continued infiltration by fire bomb detination
Phasers and lasers scopin, choking from smoke inhilation
Secret service agents are coming at me
I gotta hit em I sprayed, throw a grenade
Setting off the sprinkler system

[Verse 4: Poetic]
I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders
[Hook]

[Freestyle]
Rendezvous, special operations: team arsonists
Switch the disk and get out of there fast
We don't wanna take no risk
Code name: freestyle, alias ""the asthmatic""
Automatic full metal jackets
Static's with the diplomatic, bureaucratic tactics
We got the area secured now, triple the c-4
And get of the whole floor, you copy?
I copy that, we got the whole music business wired
So when this shit blow, ya whole empire's expired

We can live lavish and still build on the mathematics
Far precise, cut cabbage, rock ice and still civilize a savage

Glancing back at days I used to be behind them bars with heathens

At times I might waver
Sweet as a life saver
But sharp as a knife razor
I engage the crowd when I'm dropping my style off
But you can't accuse till you walking a mile in my shoes
Stressful attempts to be successful
When haters for no reason detest you is the best fuel
One of the best few special vessels of the rest you

As I let my mind walk in the massive press thoughts
Traditional medicinal sentences, fresh quotes
And facts brought to back block against the trash talk
Blast off when my 10 toes touch the asphalt
Fast walk through the forest of flash floss and gloss
Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears
You gonna switch your gears and push till shit's clear yes sir

Okay the heartbreak kid just took a couple of his magic beans
Outfit is dripping like a bowl of collard greens
I take the crown away like I was the Philippines
Flow is unnatural I got it by artificial means
Apparently my lyricism is awokening
Nature boy, think I got my third eye opening
Niggas bite the dust and it be so chokening
You won't find that one if you go Google searching it
Never work for anything, swag already purchased it
Selling my emotions and the damage so permanent
Twisting up my words like my speeches got a perm in it
Forget about my health, hope the blunt has got sherm in it
I'm the point where I can't even talk to anybody
Don't know the names of the bitches I'm making bend the body
Chop me up, chopper, chopper, chop a fucking Harley
Davidson? Maybe I can reckon a Beckham
I met a girl about as fucked as I am
Rock the boat, shipping like its #ziam
We're fucking sad so she cries on my dick
I'ma cry in her pussy and sniffle those inner lips
Lay under stars and we talk about the universe
Mentioned God and it made the conversation worse
But tell me this, how does conversation work?
Tired voice, so she think that I was sipping purp
My parents probably unaware of half the shit I do
But I guess I spilled the tea on the track, oops
There's some things that I guess will never change in you
I'd still fuck Ellen Page if she want me to
I'd still fuck Jennifer Lawrence if she want me to
I'd still fuck Emma Stone if she want me to
I'd still fuck Ella Marija if she want me to
And let me add Chloë Moretz to the list of boos
As I carry on with my life
Wondering if I was ever meant to have a wife
Wondering if I'll have some kids and call 'em mine
I'm on this earth and I only have a little time
Working together we can make this shit a paradise
Disintegrate discrimination, everybody's liked
Just help me kill this anxiety in my teen years
Build a dam for every fucking flood of tears, Seezy",rap,1994 Freestyle,-0.4,-0.2,2016

It's not you, it's me? That's what they all say
But could you leave me alone? This be my off day
Please don't tweet, don't text, don't call me
I need space and some room to breathe
Kick my shoes off, chill, and just shoot the breeze
Little margarita or a daiquiri
And I can't enjoy that if you hassle me
And last night it was really a blast
That flat little tummy and magnificent ass
You a bad little mami with some style and sass
But you blowin' up my phone makes me sick of you fast
All emotion aside, you need to hide that
Please girl, don't be a venus flytrap

Verse One
(William Pippins)


What's a day from sycamore avenue?
Was babbling mumbling verbs I gotta prove
Like science fair’s on the day that’s due, Stupid kids
Was roaming these neighborhood’s funny we know
The outcome of crime guess God gave us a conscious too
So The only way to fly out the block was to be Lebron and
Pray to God that one day these new casters would come
They Casper see they didn’t show up we traded Spaulding for guns
And trapping keys like we stacking bricks on my mommas lawns
My Homie in the cell doing time like Rolex watch, The only things
That matters to him to watch the clocks, reminiscing on patience
Them day you didn’t know hatred, phone chirping from girls so when
You had they digits you made it, Pillow talks from this lil momma
She said was-sup? The Lust burning like the flames of the Hebrew
Boys in the furnace
Holy spirit speaking son yield, we was supposed to link at 5
I missed my ride that day her house got shot inside, God’s Will

Verse Two
(Demo Freeman)

I Never graduated from college
To earn a simple degree
I rather obtain my knowledge
From cook-in workin these streets
Man its obvious my fathers figure
Were nothin but drug dealers
With more bread than jiffy like its homemade cornbread
Momma said
Don’t you run mouth
Unless you run this house
I guess i'm running out
Packing my bags
Gather my cash
I’m ducking my stepdad
Because his tendencies
Is to close to my last dad
Got war in my heart
Life like its bagdad
Lord knows my empty soul is captivated by things that keep me enslaved
To wanting to be So famous
But little do i know
That my soul was jus on the ropes
And i'm fighting to keep it close
Cuz these demons want me to fold
My heart is growing so cold

Pick up my phone

Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good

Can we walk down the aisle?

Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now
But I still got love for you

If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books
I'd marry you through conical visits, and it'd be off the hook
You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King
I'd be there for you cause I know we gotta eat
I ain't got too many friends, you know that babe

Why you tryna say you're strong and tough
Thats just gonna get your life rough
Why you tryna say your the best baller
Some people have to work hard like getting a sholar
Why you tryna say you have depression
To say that, its kinda a question
Why you tryna say you were bullied
Some people actually did and they still need a sheild

Being devoured by psychological gout

While I move forward trying to find my sound
I'm a poet with a melody, reiterate c'est la vie
Helping others through with songs as remedies
Keeping it simple, six strings and voice
Going on, it's as if that I had any other choice
Splitting my hand, blood on my guitar
If I add the sweat and tears someday I'll be a star
I dream to have my name in lights, people cheering my name
I'll be struck by the sheer anecdote again and again
I know that one day I'll be paid just to pick up a pen
And when I'm there I know I'll stay true to my friends

Now police is knocking at my door
Looking for me, but I ain't here no more, check it
Your outlaw and money, that's what I come for
With Lord J, all day, layin' the law, but
Witnesses is try'nna say they saw
A crazy madman waving the four-four, check it
The fire with the God, I strike you with the iron rod
Police, they'd rather come with the riot squad
The science of teaching, the rebel, I'm the ghetto chief'ton
The seeds, do the knowledge when the God's speaking

[Verse 4: Nat Turner]
Scout body in the party, and we wreck it tonight
Say it's a matter, get shot or you hog it on sight
Now why I'm killing cops, why I kill the judge?
Why if they find crack in them pockets they show me love?
I spit the banger, the mathematical flamer-flamer
Switch up and hit the changer, then get it, this biz is dangerous
Free the Cipher, it's 40 gangs, and 40 B
Sophisticated, the higher science of burglary
You can't fuck with the power or the pride
I'm a jump up, and nigga, jack your crack
It's Nat Turner, muthafucka, beast of the belly, squeezin' Pirellis
And shoot you for tellin' me this manufactured fire is deadly

A lot of tap dancing going on, industry buffoons
They told me not to bring out the skeletons in these rooms
But these children are doomed with these fake ass rappers lying about what they do
And these record execs overlook the rhyme, to put you in chains and give you a little shine, lock up your mind
Slave master mentality, on every nigga that's signed, so I decline with a freedom mind
Whipping' my balls at your racist comments
Right fist up all honest and I'mma do it like I promised with my soul polished not a flaw scratch on me
Liberated so I pass money
And all that monkey ish keep from round me

I just hope the world hears how these fake niggas get scared to speak up

[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name

I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar

Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands

I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?

What you got to say?

Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips

It doesn't make you sound good and to be honest its not tough...

And if he was still alive if he could hear your rap he would of commited suicide...

[Verse 3: Lil Memer & Ghwttogabe]
(Fast love) Is our bond bigger than this?
(Fast love) If I left would I be missed?
(Fast love) Let's forgive and forget
(Fast love) Do you remember when we met?
Nickel, nickel
Dime by dime
Now you're taking all my time
Now I wanna know what's fine
I wanna know what to find
Sometimes you gotta kill your mind
Because suicide
Is not the way to end your life
Just look at the good you've got inside, yeah

[Chorus: Ghwttogabe & Lil Memer]
Fast love, fast love
My life's falling apart, gassed up
The only thing I can do is try and be a rapper
With a life that's ruptured, it will be my life's rapture

Can't let 'em know the play, everything we say gotta be in code now
Die before I'll slow down

...see you back my dawg
I just pray they take the shackles off
Need my people from behind the wall
I don't even wanna answer call

[Verse 1]
This some heartfelt shit, catch a hot slug
We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly
I can't go back to the snow
No boots on my feet, wit' my sneaks full of holes
Mama did her best, but she did it on her own
When I had nothing left, still got it like I'm grown

I don't wanna see you back my dawg
I need my people from behind the walls
I don't even wanna answer calls
It breaks my heart 'cause I know what you lost

I just pray they take the shackles off
I don't even wanna answer calls
It breaks my heart 'cause I know what you lost

[Verse 2]
You got something to lose don't let 'em take it
Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces
Couple niggas doing life, growing ancient
I just wanna better the gang, let's get a spaceship
Roney still clean the block up, call me maintenance
Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican
Get my youngin drop a package off
Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved
'Cause my dawg behind the wall playing basketball
Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot
Roney like the sun, he can heat the block
We don't need to stop
We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot
Need my dawg from behind the wall
He locked up playing basketball

I don't wanna see you back my dawg
I need my people from behind the walls
I don't even wanna answer calls

This a me to an end, I ain't tryna be friends
Cause everything good truly comes to an end
Talking life, relationships, and now I'm rhyming my plight
Sit in dark room, late-night, scared of the flight
Cause I don't want this shit to end, I'ma slave for my life
Sometimes, I wonder what we on, what's beyond this?

Hope I live to make a change in the world, 'fore I go

Hoping out the passenger like Trey, there he go
This my plight, life stories
Living vicious all night
Gang signs, hang time
Jump me, in it for life
Throw me on that corner, get me stabbed, it's alright
Feel like nobody love me, and my heart get cold at night
For the devil creeping on me, I ain't looking for the light
I ain't shit to these kids
I ain't shit to this bitch
They just look at me like dollars, give a fuck if I'm dead
It's just on to the next one, and fuck what he said
Even if I give a arm and leg
This my soul and spirit coming out, hold up really
Dawg, go and pardon me
I let it bleed, hit the vessels and the arteries

Nobody likes to mention
White progressive philantrophic extortion of our condition
We ignore it 'til we wanted an apartment for us to live in
And is rented by a liberal proponent of capitalism
Who believes that the God's gift to Black and Brown people
Then appropriate the culture, of which they are a vulture
Caught the rollers on the lady with her baby in the stroller
Who was raised where they just moved to from in the zone
It's the old neighborhood with the whiter population
Under the codenames, ""Up and coming, revitalization""
Collective, urban, it's even more disturbin'
When the transplant treats the native family with discernment
I lived it, you learned it, you bought it, I earned it
I'm natural, you burned it
You went to city hall and got a permit to make us live a hundred miles away
Then question our credentials when we represent the Bay, look

They used us and fooled us
Removed us and replaced us with food trucks
They sued us and looted us
We assumed trust and replaced us with food trucks
They used us and fooled us
Removed us and replaced us with food trucks
They sued us and looted us
We assumed trust and they replaced us with food trucks
[Verse 2]
People laughed at me and Paris when we started sayin'
Oakland looked a lot like Portland
Then we laughed back when we read about
Another First Fridays based up in Ashland, Oregon
Stigmatized the ghetto 'cause it's full of liquor stores and blunt rappers
While these medical marijuana and artesian beer drafters
Get the benefit of the doubt, but if they are young or Black
Are with the thought of legal weed and hipster rap attract laughter
Sometimes, I feel like I'm hatin' for no reason at all
But when I hit the block, there's barely no Black people at all
Or no Latinos at all, or Filipinos at all
Just art collectors and loft, do they respect us or naw?
Ridin' BART, I'm in awe, had all the wealthy techies come and go
West Oakland station, mission statement, hella comfortable
The great migration of Blacks from country to city
Is slowly but surely returnin' to how it was once befo'

Hi Mrs. Lynch, this is Mrs. Zubrod. I'm calling from Deerfield Elementary about your son, Jason. Um, I've been having a few concerns just about his ability to focus in class. There are some options that I've briefly discussed. Um, we see this a lot with children and it might be some form of ADD. I'm not a doctor so I would suggest that maybe-
Uh, Mrs. Lynch, this is Mr. Bailey, Jason's fifth-grade teacher. I'm calling 'cause I'm very concerned about your son. It seems very possible that he will not pass the fifth grade. He's been failing very regularly-
Mrs. Lynch, this is Principal Reynolds, calling again for the third time. Please give us a call back as soon as you can. Jason has been suspended from school yet again for getting into a fight. Um, he's becoming a real problem for the kids. It seems he's getting into an altercation every other day. Um, we've tried to reach out, we're trying to help him. But there's only so much I can do. Mrs. Lynch, we have no choice but to suspend your son immediately-
This is Detective Pearson with the Third District Police Department. We are searching for Jason Mills; he's been implicated in a armed robbery case. We have a good bit of evidence that Jason is involved. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible. It's nothing to worry about, hope I hear from you soon-
Hi, this is Stacey from State Farm. The total for this case will be 7,550 dollars. Please give me a call back and let me know how you'd like to process the payment-
You have ten minutes remaining on this call

Who diminished? Who the witness? Who detective?
Who the medic? Who the dead? Who arrested?
You the dead, you the lesson
We survived, we ain't stressin'
I was tryna live it, I was tryna be it
I lived with my mother and stepfather, both had degrees, was heated
Went the college route
But I doubt that I'm going to college now
I was tryna be flyer than Batman so I got me the strap, man
And I started stealing and turned into Robin now
I'm just a middle-class nigga who's class was a mixture
Of them spellin' bee winners and them PG killers
Flop, flop, flop, flop, hit your ass with bananas, they gorillas
Knock, knock, knock, knock at my door, asking me to come and kick it
I was different, see, my family distanced me but I was curious
The mystery of chilling down the street, knowing I shouldn't be
Was lit to me and that's the reason why that I am literally
The only one to go to jail in my family's history

Steal the strap from my neighbor's safe, brrat-brrat nigga
They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers

I'm a ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga

Hear the church bell ringing
Murder every rapper better start repenting
Heard of every rap you fuckers spitting
Take your herd to the lab and start re penning
Now they singing the same
With limited brains
Tryna mimic for fame
They killing the game
They will never be tame
Taking the reigns
And im making a name
You the best rapper in the school?
Call yourself a leader I will show you how to rule
On this beat defeat ya and your punishment is cruel
Ask me for a feature im a freeze ya you a fool
Think I might not kill ya you like Freiza im Goku
Wasn't gonna feed ya but this shit is getting deeper im  competing to be-seat the rappers I lampoon
Callin me a freak
You wallow in defeat
Control alt delete, you reboot I resume
Cuz Your Autotune
Is so out of tune
So now I presume
That you’re a buffoon
Take trash like raccoons
Airheads, like balloons
My bad that was criminal
You know who you are
So this is not subliminal
Pull up in a car
Your condition is now critical
Ripping up your art
What's left of it is spiritual
{Verse 2}
To tell you the truth
Its a crime scene when I get in the booth
Look at rhyme schemes its getting coo coo
Its so obscene merci beaucoup
Know what that means? That means thank you
If you don't believe search on Google
Im like chlorine I clean the pool
The one with genes that none of you knew
But im coming in through
Coming in fru-ition
With the ammunition
And on a mission
To show im different
To all these bitches
They load the clips in
And Damn they missed it
Im on some slick shit
A bomb im spitting
I take the pin and
Take the pen
And I throw the nades
Into virgin kids that
Gone ballistic
Cuz they are so lit
{Verse 3}
In quotes you see
Everything I say
Is tongue in cheek
Rappers gonna spray at my physique
Changing up the waves
Im like mystique
All they gonna say
My lines antique
Just so they remain
Right at their peak
Ima go and frame
This as perfect
Cuz I Spitfire
You’re Mozambique
Cuz I'm an old head
Fire off a diss
And now they bolted
Snakes are gna hiss
They so revolting
They soul is open
And ima close it
No room for moping
Im cold I'm frozen
Home alone ima trump
Macaulay Culkin
Writing and they stumped
On Green Im Hulking
Wannabes i corrupt
Ive barely spoken
Scary and they jump
Cuz I've awoken
From their provoking
Shaken and choking
Give rhymes in bulking
This scheme just won't end
And now they hoping
That theres a cure
For this pathogen
Disease so pure
Have to cope and
They're unsure
Doctors they phoning
{Chorus}
I'm not having any of this shit
I will handle petty disrespect
I will dismantle everything  you say
And will show you i am here to stay

One punch now run it back six zero
Touchdown bitch go and run it back
Come against me itll be fourth down you runts go punt to the field and track
Cuz your field in tracks appears to be whack
Need a peer to smack you back on track
When your backs on track
Ima prevail and derail a bitch like its Amtrak
Cuz in all degrees im meant to be mentally
The best emcee on mp3s so i just speed to hit 90
Thats the right angle on all fours form a rectangle
Find it a cute to think you obtuse
Got a screw loose cuz you're in my shadow

Do the dash on the cops, turn my shit on sports mode (Skrrt)
Got a text from the plug sayin', ""Send a big load""
Up need a few pots, he whippin' on a big stove (Stove)
Gotta stash all the shit when a nigga hit the road (Road)
Cause the shit gon' get sold
Couple bitch niggas told
Couple bitch niggas snitched
I'm just tryna get rich
Why your ho around me? Nigga, grab your bitch
Think they tryna set the plan, I'm 'bout to grab my stick (Damn)
[Chorus]
Brought my reader and my writer on the road with me
Yesterday I bought a brand new strap and it hold fifty
Nigga try to take something, I'ma give his ass the whole 50
A nigga's bitch just called my phone like, ""Baby, can I hold fifty?"" (Hello?)
Run this shit up on my own, you niggas wasn't on the road with me
Street nigga made a half a million off a laptop (Laptop)
Beat my uncle ass 'cause I caught him smokin' crack rocks (Damn)
Gave your bitch backshots
Niggas better soon as they hear the strap pop
Put a new beam on my chop like it's Black Ops (Bow)
Swipin' these cards everyday, a nigga can't stop
Wait 'til this tape drop
Pourin' up straight drop
Got a Gucci headband on like AI
I just popped ten Percs and I ain't high (Damn)

Got a couple hologram scannable IDs
Get a VPN just to switch my IP
And I get half off with IKEA
I'm so blowed, boy, I can't see ya
And I feel just like John Cena
Your bitch asked could she hit my reefer
Got to Kony, get a pita
Fake ID, my name is Peter
Your bitch a fuckin' leecher

We don't player-hate, we regulate in this camp
Y'all do what you can, we do what y'all can't
Amazing like Luther once the beat's looped up
Rock the bi-dells and tore your whole group up

See me prima donna, breakin' the nails

And I flows like CK One
Somethin' in they hoes like she fakes none, aight
I'm the quintessential mistress of the instrumental
Y'all could wait to exhale, I'ma vent a little
Set it off like Jada robbin' the bank
I got this money thing covered from the dollar to the franc
The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin' backwards
Nothin' y'all said made an ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out, got reversible rhymes
We could go pop with it or run the block with it
Never before done 'til The Firm did it
If it ain't for the paper, then, nah, we not with it
Got to stay driven so we can stay drivin'
Vroom to my whole crew, gotta pull a diamond
See me lookin' hot in the crop SL
Gettin' richer, you wish you ran game this well
Rock the bells

Uh, is it raw? (Uh)
Uh-huh, to the core, uh

​Put on a beat, play my life in reverse then write a verse
​I was in hell, dyin' of thirst, the ravens were in the trees starin' at me while they perched
​
​But my success was written before my birth
​I excel from the energy I exert
​The world cracked open when I dropped the merch
​Zombies crawlin' out of the ground clawin' the earth

​Went out to Rome, spent a weekend in Greece
​Poured liquor in a glass and rolled weed in a leaf
​Momma cried out to Jesus, ""Lord keep him in peace!""
​They stay marginalizing Yeezus and they sleepin' on me

​I keep it raw with a sexy persona
​I play my role like a professional roller
​To move around, I do golds on the front and root canals on all the rest of my molars, Petie

​I told my Momma that I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best
​Momma I'mma do my best
​They comin' for my head, they comin' for my head
​But momma I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best
​
​Niggas don't know shit about loyalty nowadays
​I try not to blame 'em cos they weren't raised how I was raised
​They was sneak dissin' for years so I ain't phased
​Cos i got the title belt and a head full of tidal waves
​Not to mention the ladies that I done slayed
​Layin' the younger hoes and I'm lyin' about my age
​and niggas hatin', but real recognise...
​well you know the rest of the sayin', we ain't related
​but i will say that my legacy's understated
​and the power of my penmanship can't be debated
​plus money's comin' in nowadays
​I'm elated, the car note was due yesterday and I can pay it
​
​It's the simple things that make me happy
​the girls that call me papi, my babies that call me daddy
​the fans that listen and help me like a taxi
​she got her hair straightened and came and gave me the nappy
​everybody rap but not everybody is savvy
​so i can understand why my success make you aggy
​plus your girl put my cover on that avi
​swingin' the tomohawk, you get scalped by the apache
​man these niggas tried to play me like a race card
​but i got it locked like a bait car

Thinkin a moment's gone past
Motions movin so slow

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, she was seventeen years old, life was good
Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
No one laughs when it happens to someone you know
Happens every single day in the World that we live in (yeah)

Yeah, he was seven years old and came from nothin (yeah)
Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
Doesn't matter what we come from, we just don't know
Where our life's gonna go in this World that we live in
It never turns out how you thought it would, did it?

Get the fuck up out my house, steady screaming about some fuck you
Cause girl you won't know what to do if I take away my ride
Gotta ride the train now, You ain't got a damn thang now girl
And you gon' miss this love, You gon' miss it

[Verse 1: Thugga Massina]
Listening to Sparkle, you better be careful
She say I got her twisted and she salty like a pretzel
Man this bitch disrespectful, I gave her the world
I took her out them Hanes and I gave her La Perla
I thought she was my girl so ever since the start
I was right behind Kevin, following my heart
Now you saying that I’m parched, girl you know you wack
Body like a coke bottle but the soda flat
Rat - you gon' give up that plastic? Michael Kors and all that shit?
Cause you wanna act ratchet? Girl you such a good actress –
Cause you say you good, you say you Gucci
But I know truthfully – that ain’t about nothing
Cause you gon' miss this loving
[Hook: Guala]
Shawty you gon' miss this loving, loving, loving
Shawty you gon' miss this thugging, thugging, thugging
Shawty you gon' miss this fucking, fucking, fucking
Shawty you gon' miss this love
Love, Shawty you gon' miss it

[Verse 2: Thugga Massina]
Remember all them nights I was gone off half a pill
Eating out the box like I got a Happy Meal
I crack the whip, then your bra and panties come up missing
Asking what’s my name like Rumpelstiltskin
There ain’t no competition and you can come petition
Ain’t nobody signing that, can’t get your vagina back
That pussy mine, that’s what you told me
Then like a pinwheel, you blowed me
You said it’s been the same shit since high school
You need a lil’ more like the girl that sing with Ja Rule
Well if you need space, that’s what I’ll provide you
Michael Phelps can’t swim in a child’s pool
Besides boo, I’ma see you again
‘cause it’s his turn but it’s my tee you are in-
When you sleep at night, I know you need that pipe
‘cause he don’t beat that right, and he don’t eat that right

You may have heard a lot about Rap Genius lately
But I suppose you have been looking at it rather sedately
Just another boring lyric site, nah, don't be fooled
Rap Genius ain't just a site where you get lyric-schooled
It's a collaborative annotation platform where you can explain anything
From lyrics to the Bible, we annotate everything
From TV shows to sports to the latest in games
To GRANDMA'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...
Nah, we ain't ashamed!
So how do they get, so many annotations without paying people?
It's quite clever actually
And if you write fluently, concise, and factually
You'll eventually find yourself part of the editors faculty
Where you can be free of the white hat normality

[Verse 2: Ryan Vice]
Ayo, we branched out to all different divisions
It's not just rap, we got poetry, rock and news
Plus a whole bunch of other crap
And being a great editor, with all you contribute
Can eventually earn you the moderator attribute
And then you will be able to reign over others
Gain some power, recognise talent where it is due
Oh what... I forgot about IQ!
IQ can be a motivator for many
Writing good annotations can get you plenty
But IQ whoring?
That's a definite penalty
[Verse 3: Ryan Vice]
Ugh, one more and I'm signing out

But all this great stuff aside, you wanna know the real reason
I stay allied, to the RG fam, representin' worldwide
It's the staff yo! Their friendly in nature
Mahbod, Shawn, Tom, Jeremy, Illan, Tobias, they always stay ill 'n
They got the mastermind persona
To keep the site running
And the Tech guys are great, making sure we stay update
To the annotation platform, that has improved my love for writing
Austin, Gavin, Tomi, you guys always stay trill
And Verified Artists? Most genius thing ever
This is a great leap for man, one of raps hugest endeavors
Which works quite a charm
Getting primary perspectives
On a line that may create an interpretation dilemma
Being able to connect with rappers themselves
Establishing a deeper connection between fans and artists is great for the health!

If you going through this
This for you
Just think about it real deep

When we were together
Never thought two'd become three
So, now what? Is it over?
This I can't believe

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion [?]
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment
[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

I'm in a nightmare
Of Ganondorfs that don't fight fair
Light prayers I don't trip over flight stairs
On the quest to be the Master Sword's master
I'm dealing with the hassle, of running through these Castles
Pack my items like book bags in high schools
I'm on the dash from Spirit Temple to Hyrule
From Underwater to the thrones of King Zora
I'm trying to save the day, but I'm so out of order
Forgive me, I'm just a kid yo I'm new to thangs
I'm using gadgets like Jewelry and Boomerangs
To try to sneak through these fortresses and walls
I'm trying to stand tall fulfilling my Clan's call
I'm the prophecy told by the Sages and Elders
That rises to the challenge to rescue Zelda
But right now I'm not feeling too stellar
Trapped in this Prison Cellar
Through all these castle walls
I'm going insane
Chains, bars, flames, bombs, all coming at me
But I'm feeling fine to rescue the girl
But, it's been so long still I can't find you

Please don't tempt me, my mission is simply
To rescue the Princess but I come up empty
I've crashed the same Castle, fought the same Koopas
Pass the lava pits, crushed the same Goombas
Don't get it twisted, I'm 8-Bit Old School
But if I see another little midget from Toadstool
Tell me the Princess is in another Castle
I'm gonna leave 'em to be snack food for Bowser
But I'm not given up, my boldness is risen up
And this girl that I love won't be a prisoner
Another day, so I dash Pipes to World 8
Fantasying we're holding hands through some peril gates
I reached the Castle, feeling like its the final hour
Here come Bowser, I grab a Flower for Fire Power
I knocked him in the lava, and got the Princess home
Then got stuck in Minus World, Negative Zone

She had potential so I thought that I would mold her
(Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""

I got her name and her number
I said ""Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh

We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said ""Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect""
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo

You see, I'm not your average nigga

It's like a...
In a jigsaw puzzle piece my son
Between the heart of autumn leaves and where the trees come from
We see the blossom in the picture puzzle needs might want
A thousand pictures that Picasso might at-least have done
Man I can i can feel the burn on these dry thumbs
It takes a man to find his inner-peace so he can finally grease thy blunt
When complications seem to tease my tongue
I find the piece a thousand times unique, so one time for the feed my crumbs
Before the moon comes down,i'll need my gut
Believing all the pictures of the puzzle got the east raised up
Oh all the pictures got the east raised up
Well i got nothing for a thousand in the story trilogy comes from
It's like a...
Puzzle incomplete, well done
Another mystery to solve, let it breath round one
Oh yea
[Verse 2: Solve The Problem]

We ain't the people of the struggle, we the pieces of the puzzle...
And the point is to put together a picture from all the pennies and the peanuts that we hustle
Dealing with debts and the evils in the jungle but we 'bout to get it popping like a needle and a bubble...POP!
I'm just playing, i'm just saying
I'm just looking for the answers am i saying i'm insane
I'm deranged, by the questions in my brain and their saying
What's the purpose? (nothing)
What if it's all worthless?
What if we all live in a curse?
Yo' what's the word?
What's the verdict?
Heaven or furnace
I never worshiped
Anything but myself and the soils that I was birthed in
Perfect...

Forbade and then locked in a cage

In another chapter which turns another page
Getting played and sent on a wild goose chase

Will there be a day in the shade?
Is there a way when we got to find a way to make pay?
Would work still be waiting for you when you awake?
To come back to the home that is laid to find that the floors had been paved
No matter what is placed on the plate
One thing that we will never do is Fade
Could it be right because we all make mistakes?
It is difficult to keep it real with the fake
Maybe laws should be tried again at a later date
With plenty of space to move away but have to stay
Where one can be in the same place but in a different State
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Handed a short end of the stick to slice the cake
Not a hand to aide in the crack between the quake
False representing evil ways by appearing saved
Out of all of the money made there is a breach in the safe
It doesn't matter what someone has at stake

Having to be talked to while they rave a rant all Day

As the smoke from my blunt, bellows
The clouds form and below
I can sense the devil scheming
Give me nightmares but I heard sleep is for the weak
Take another drag on my blunt
And look at at the mountains and streams
Damn, This shit go hard
Pray to God
But this life of sin got these peoples ears perked up
I ain't scared of death
I ain't scared to leave the earth
Came from the dirt
Freedom is my only bet
In this life that we live
My life is their to give
I'm a living lesson trying to be a living legend
Even Crimson know, I'm trying to be an Icon
Megatron in my prime
Optimus to the optimum
You can feel the life
You can feel the vibrations
When I come with the rhyme

Made me open my Third Eye like Mandela
Fourth dimension, fifth floor
Six doors
All black looking like Genii
I'm a phantom, the flow go ghost
I'm with Vicpac
Gold chain might Toast to a new era
As I smoke my Hayze
Chip on my shoulder

In the old capital, an intellectual
These days got me freeing my trapped soul

Verse One

I stopped writing rhymes on paper a long time ago
Cos that cannot be copy and pasted into the liner notes
And now I hardly use my MPC
Because I find it too restrictive when I’m making these beats
But yo’ I still use a valve mic
Because my vocals record clear
And people tell me that is what it sounds like
I got a PC and a Mac
So I can choose between Cubase and Logic when I build a track
The way I work is more flexible and the library of sounds available
And accessible’s tremendous, I still release music independent
The running time of my catalogue is endless
I’m more meticulous listening to audio
To make better music for the people who support me yo’
So for the fans who reach out with the messages
The Africans, Asians, English and Americans
My people in Europe, Australia, Canadians
I hope the music I make will bring some radiance into your life
Could be the words that I’m saying
Or the beats that are playing that can keep you maintaining
Hah’, so let me end this on a dope note
Something you can tell to all your people’s as a dope quote
You may have heard it before, but yo’ it’s mad sick

146,Sinderella Mann,"Intro:
Psssss hey you look listen I gotta real talk true story I gots to tell about
A very sad situation that's unfortunately how life happens in reality your gonna know oh so very very well

Verse 1:
Yo what up with all these buster lame deer
Who just can’t hang or bang
Let alone be a brother from another mother playing it cool with poise like
True R&P emcee trailblazers that’s down by law to honorable
Hip hop
Causes prepared for whatever life throws at him
Generating interest
Not being boring likе some lame-o’s cause I’m spitting rhymеs for the unlucky kids
Without a dad or mom that got cheated in life blessing them reciting this psalm prayer
Hopefully to be answered as providence eventually so sucker lame deer playing adulting games
See the error in there ways that could never afford
To help
One another or be honest let alone fathom to understand why is that imagining
What it’s like to be younger again getting shafted caught in a dead end job
Life happens being stuck in the rat races maze thats why sinderella manns
Staying truest in this krush groove funkyfresh
Never stale
Just new photosynthesized oxygen every little step
I take by myself
On this lone road not you Bobby brown to move people untraceably with power musics
Meaning that lame deer benignly neglect sinderella mann
For filthy rat emcees
Polluted corny cliched hogwash crap copycunts can duplicate but fail to bite or replicate
This multi spectrual flow let alone figure out what
Makes sinderella mann tick
Trying to mock his highnesses hotshot heroine overdose mind boggling
Keep it gangster with ya flair your trying to diss but don’t even know the half
Like any mitch bade trick without rhymes to recite yourself
Jelly sickling saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 2:
Whose living the coolest baller tipping for life thats got it made in the shade
Is what matters most fuck your opinion outside that conclusion
Without
Bullshit popularity contests dammit from east coast to west coast
Keep the crossover
Sinderella manns gonna stay frosty like a snowman using this funk while
Many act as if they enjoy being conventionally boring in some square trendy
Predictable life cycling manner sinderella mann
Won’t ever understand
Others lame deer games who shall remain nameless
Because your soo vain
You couldn’t keep the mic hot and you probably think this song is about you dont you dont you
Lacking Rockwell’s voice and rick James’s guitar skills
Cause you never had
The option or choice sinderella mann does barking preternatural powers in the dark
Rocking rhymes ripping the mic all indolent imbeciles can't relate to
With disgust in your eyes
Being another brick in the wall pussyfooter that doesn’t have shit on true loc’ed out
Hip hop gangsters like sinderella mann dropping refillable scripts to blow
Your fucking brains out with funky grammar as a certified jammer living to win
Down to expose any flaker for the fraud you are through
This melody
Thats strong enough to visualize celestial astrology
Coming to life
Thats very real unless your left behind saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many

Meet me at the Bungalow bar
Never got along like Mufasa and Scar
Sorry but I'm not, wallet for a sense of humor
Pocket watch, [?] turning into humorous
A bit of Scotch with a line of white to wipe the edge
Black swayde while I swipe the keys of the ledge
I see your rocks but that makes me smile
Swallowed too much pride for my fingers to dial
Powerful appetite of the hungriest king
Hand up [?] to the invincible ring
Connecting the summit to plummet the scars [?] I put a gun to my head before I tell you that I miss you
20 feet from the curb I about to pull into
I slide away my copy of the taming of the Schru
A fake grin, but it's already edged in
Let the games begin

[Chorus]
It's been a while
Since I've seen your face and
You know what I came to do
It's been a while
But we're back in the same place
If you owe me new
[Verse 2]
If walls were personified they could smell the lies perfuming from the silk sheets and the warm thighs
Look into my fathers eyes, read it like a line of text
Peaking at the mountain top, asks the clouds what's next
Spent the night in the bottom of a bottle
Should've listened Plato, should've listened to Aristotle
Wipe the frown of my face and then take it slow
Cigarettes for the show, it's time to read what I sow
Maybe stick around, we can swim down the rainbow heading east bound
Two tabs and a lock on the door
Is all we need to see what our first day got in store
You laughed because you think it's funny
I come back from the bathroom to give you money
The phone rings, time to give a dog a bone
Get the fuck out of here and let me fly on my own
Now I'm drifting (drifting)

Eighth code of law, don’t crawl where you suffer from
If I brawl my thoughts together while I toughen up
I’m might make sure that I leave, don’t cover some
Preaching from the skies, call it lies, where I summon up
Scrounging through the maze, locked prey, count on false help
But you outta days, looking lazy making maybe
Born original, don't die a copy, early times primal, aboriginal
Aiding fuels subliminal
Stop being negative, stop being repetitive
Watching all them do the same things while I write the narratives
Memories including lost lanes, felt shames
How many profound hours do you reminisce the names?
I only got some left in me, it’s “care” that I theft to free
The countless measures of the past fade when my “temper” plea
This is the last stretch of the things I could’ve seen

I'm trying real hard to get away from these drugs

He saved me from myself when I was alone
He had long arms, long legs, two holes in his face
No expressions, faceless, we both look the same

Covered in the Blood of Christ, from head to toe
Hedge of protection, top, bottom, midsection
Angelic forces, ain’t no more discourses
Marriage made in heaven
Won’t be no divorces
They said it’s 50/50
But I only go 100
Times infinity
But you really can’t count it
Trophy on my desk
But I’m really tryna mount it
God gave me a test
And I’m not tryna flunk it
I’m swinging for the fences
And I’m not tryna bunt it
Got a homerun
When they said, “Go home son”
Well I went home
And bought the neighborhood for fun
They like “who dat?”
Well I’m not J. Cole
But I’m Suave Sterling
You can see it with my mole
I give you fresh raps
Better go get yo deo
[Chorus]
I got my name from shampoo
I guess you can say I Winnie
How many verses you like?
I guess you can say that’s many
How much God love me?
I guess you can say that’s plenty
What’s your next move?
Guess

[Verse 2]
Lights, camera, action
What you see is what you get
Don’t need to front
When God’s backing all of it
He raises up a standard
When they flooding all of it
Noah had an ark
Call it start a Covenant
Paint a picture
Paint a perfect picture
Paint a perfect picture of a man that’s not perfect
Though he’s not perfect, man this man is not useless
They made a Muriel but you can’t call it a Eustace
What’s a man?
A man is just a man
Until you throw the sauce on him, just like a personal pan
I give delivery
They always wanna give me tips
Wasn’t with me in the gym
But wanna see me do a flip
East of Atlanta
I got a Future
Everything is Gucci
Just like Young Lucci
I love God just like they love Lucy
I’m making, making, making boss moves just like they were Ross moves
[Chorus]
I got my name from shampoo
I guess you can say I Winnie
How many verses you like?
I guess you can say that’s many
How much God love me?
I guess you can say that’s plenty
What’s your next move?
Guess

[Verse 3]
They don’t know you
They, they, they, don’t know you
They don’t know you
Like they think they really know you
You looking at my face
You not looking at my heart
You don’t know my next
You just only know my start
You look at what I’ve done
Not at what I do
Turn the mirror over
Begin to look at you
Before you cast a stone
What’s inside them bones?
Before you throw a stick
Think about it quick
You didn’t know my Savior
So you won’t know me
I really get it now
I feel like T.I.P
Let’s get a hustle now
I hustle to the next
I don’t like to argue
I take it to the Text
Your expectations
Are unreal
I don’t believe them
Like the Boogey Man
Put your faith in man
It’s gonna fail
I hope you get the message
Like an email
[Chorus]
I got my name from shampoo

How much God love me?

I got no sense, but the flow's sick

Then you know you've been attacked by the no sense twins
Me and the beat, still ain't got no sense
Oh shit, read it and weep
Imma bounce in the bounce, more bounce to the ounce
Bring em out cause they down for the count and I'm out
Got an issue with women, which one should I choose first?
The two flirts or the one with the blue purse
Two words: Sonic Orgy

Above all pointer fingers, put my life for the books

[Verse 1]
At this point, I truly hate the rich girl
She told on me for dropping an eraser. What a snitch girl
The rich boy just got expelled
But I don't really care and I don't wish them well
Cause he bought all the Minecraft books Scholastic had in stock
And his dad bought all the toys that I ever could've bought
It's the new Scholastic Book Fair and there's chaos where it's at
So once you finish checking out you better run and watch your back
Still going to the book fair and I'm tired of trying
It's like Dababy on baby except it's fighting on fighting
Cause there's young crazies with rabies outside trying and trying
To take all of your items after you just finish buying

They'll steal your nostalgia and trade it for a little ridicule

[Verse 2]
A little kid came up; was like age 9
Was reading records from Guinness; was like page 9
He said, ""Can I have a look?"" so I handed over the book
Until he ran off with what he took
The ripped Vans of a smuggy crook
I chased the kid to the door of his mother's car
Cause I was just about to finish the page with Tony Hawk
Ran close then I got him
He dropped it. I caught it
Worth it even though I think my ribs just got kicked in

[Verse 1]
They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn’t come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles, but now I’m Socrates
With philosophies
I’m in my tree house please don’t bother me
And now it’s lookin’ like hella smoke
Under age they lettin’ me pass the velvet rope
And this life getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star, Texas

You don’t think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong

I swear I’m gonna turn this from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon
Hatin’ on even on the roof I’m upper echelon

Your naked body on top of me
I won't listen, but [?]
But that was way back when
Now you see there no stoppin' me
I won't play you like them
I won't loose you like them
Yeah, yeah
So I fuck her real quick, I was in and out
Then we went dine out in In n' Out
I ask her now, questioned her why she doubt
What that shit be all about
I ask her now, questioned her in what she know
Why she never wanna show
So I fuck her while I play Pokemon Go
She got emotions so they never show
Yeah
Back in the day we was tryna get high
House out in Eagle, garage on the side
Me, Michael [?]
Smoking purple, Donatello
Seven prime times, Melo
I'm a really different fellow
I stay high forever, mellow
Yeah, Gino!

Thoughts are most dirtiest
Gots my car swervin' in-
To a tree
Burning Uffy
You baby can you come to me
Caught up in the COT
In the city with low trees
I still got the W, no Bush
But she hit my phone saying I'm no good
What?
All my ex's live in Boise, cause I'm Ylti
Ylti
Shit, I think they even live in the same building
Ylti
Imma knock down all the trusts in that building
Ylti
Fuck all the trust that we were building

Many tears cried, a river we could smoke by
She too wet I put her in some rice
Girl, you need to put your slices
In my piehole, to shut my piehole
I'm tryna fuck you 'fore I go
Girl, I just want lick your lucky fin
I spit more bars than where Uffy sit

I hope a lil rain don't come
And wash away this love
Down the drain
I forgot who I was for a second
I need you to give me a second
You know I'm the one, never second
I need you again any second

I saw this post by Karat Kev saying ""Think about your impact
What do you do for your community, do you give back?""
Anyone can kick phat slick raps
Bunch of fuckin pissants talking bout they shivs dacked, that shit's wack
I ain't ever flipped packs, I just try to kick facts
Motherfuckers break under pressure just like a Kit-Kat
Saw your little track and I just skipped that
Motherfuckers stupid and I bet they never fuckin heard a Nip track
That's real talk
It's like it isn't 'bout the art no more
It's all about your designer clothes and the cars you got
Intelligence isn't respected no more and it makes me sick
But I'm thе artist that they was asking for
But just be hard and raw, that's that normal shit
What is normal shit? I guess it's fuckin talking shit
Going on Instagram, posting a bit of corny shit
Start a beef with somеone, go back and forth for the audience, performing it
When one you lose, the'll applaud the shit
Remember when it's all said and done, no one talkin it like Jordan is
And imma never fuckin call it quits
And fuck you to anyone praying that I be falling cause I won't
I'm tryna give the youth some hope
Let you know you ain't alone, stay strong, untie the rope, it ain't a joke
We all tryna stay afloat, but the doctors don't understand us, they give us pills to cope and that's a joke
And as I'm rowing in this boat
Paddling against my depression, I'm sinking in this moat and I just mope, yeah
And I ain't got the right words to say
Everytime I think of fuckin speaking I just choke, and that's the realest shit I ever spoke
I been tryna get clean but I keep dropping the soap
So I smoke to stay high all the time to get by with my life
I don't really wanna die, so I'm high all the time to stop thinking
Cause I'm numb to the pain, I'm thinking fuck the fame
Motherfuckers try to come at me, I've dug up my grave
My split personalities are fuckin one in the same
I saw this post by Karat Kev, got me thinking bout my legacy
Will my enemies remember me? Wanna be legendary
I'm tryna be something that they will never be
I let em in, I let em see everything inside of me till I rest in peace
And I made it pop without ever making a melody
Let's go, ARGHHHH

Almost lost my fuckin breath, cunt

I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis
After we take the organs out then we mail them to Jesus

I'm on and I ant ever going off
The only time I'mma go off is when I get a hold of a mic
Its like nothing can stop me and thats the same way that its gonna be like
Is this real life dont seem like reality, Mentality
Don't even attempt to say the word battle me
That's like wishing for death let me go grab my scythe
I do it as a hobby and a passion don't ever think im doing it just to bust my rep
Or get my name in the press
And another reason why I do it cause im blessed
God gave me this for a reason I know it can't be related to treason
And I want to thank god for the fact that I am still breathing
On the Inside im still bleeding so dont judge me form the out
Cause you don't know what im about
Most rappers get aroused when I spit, Awaken
Your spot has now been taken
I'm On
