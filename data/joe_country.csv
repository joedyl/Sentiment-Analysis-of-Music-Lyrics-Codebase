Her mom walks around in a pink nightgown, sandals and white socks

I was standing on the sidewalk in 1945
In Jacksonville, Illinois
When asked what my name was there came no reply
They said I was a deaf and sightless half-wit boy
But Louis was my name, though I could not say it
I was born and raised in New Orleans
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it
On a barge and a prayer upstream
Well, they searched for mother
And they searched for father
And they searched till they searched no more
And the doctors put to rest their scientific tests
And they named me 'John Doe No. 24'
And they all shook their heads in pity
For a world so silent and dark
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery
But so too is the human heart
And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crepe jasmine bloomed on St. Charles Avenue
Though I couldn't hear the bells
Of the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew
And if I were an old man returning
With my satchel and porkpie hat
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon
And I'd hit everyone on Basin after that
[Verse 2]
Well, the years kept passing as they passed me around
From one state ward to another
Like I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found
Always missing the other
And they gave me a harp last Christmas
And all the nurses took a dance
Well, lately I've been growing listless
I've been dreaming again of the past
I'm wandering down to the banks
Of the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand
I am seven years old and I feel my daddy
Let go of my hand
While I drew breath no one missed me
So they won't on the day that I cease
Put a sprig of crepe jasmine with me
To remind me of New Orleans

I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
Why I was so ragged folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
But deep down inside dad was hurtin'
'Cause he done the best he could

[Verse 1]
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
Education that he never had
But he did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops we raised
Barely paid the bills we made

[Verse 2]
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Placed his hands on my shoulder and with tears he said
[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Verse 4]
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See I was the oldest of the family
And everybody was depending on me

[Verse 5]
Now here's the path that everybody's on
Mamas been living in a brand new home
Lord, knows it took a lot of sweat and tears
And my daddy's blood to help us through the teas

[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Interlude]
Daddy had been sick for a long time, flat on his back
Every evening after we'd finished our chores and eat our dinner
We'd all go into papa's room to cheer him up a little
And this particular day, Dad was in good spirits
Sitting on his side of the bed telling mama how good she looked
When all of a sudden papa had a pain in his chest
I was too young to understand, talking about a heart attack here
Mama rushed all of us out of the room into the hallway
About ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes
She called out to me, ""Patches, patches get in here boy
You're daddy want to see you.""
I went running to papa's room, there papa lay
Daddy had tears in his eyes, I knew something was wrong
'Cause daddy was a poor man but all of his life he'd been a proud man
I knelt down on one knee beside the bed, papa put his hand on my shoulder
He said, ""Patches, Patches boy, the hammer of life done beat
Your old papa down to the ground and I ain't got nobody
To turn to to take care of mama and the young ones.""
""So, what I want you to do is promise me son
Is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama
As much as you can, I said, ""Papa, I'm gonna do my best.""
But little did I know then like I know right now
That trying to climb life's mountain
Searching for a top when there ain't no top
Sometimes you find yourself frustrated, lazy
But every time I feel like I can't live my life like I want to
My mind goes back to the day when I see those tears in my daddy's eyes
But most of all I remember his words
""Patches, I'm depending on you boy.""
Every time I feel like giving up I hear his voice
""Patches, Patches, Patches, Patches.""
[Verse 6]
""I'm depending on you son
I tried to do me best, it's up to you to do the rest.""
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best, it up to you to do the rest.""
""Patches, I'm depending on you son

She was sitting pretty on the front step
She said, ""hey baby, are you done yet?
Are you gonna work all day?""

She said, ""I'm headed inside, babe""

She turned and asked if I needed anything

What the world is really like when you're living in the hood

You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood

Late last night I was a-headin' home
Walking through some deep dark woods
Through the brush I heard a ghost a-moan
I saw men in big black hoods
Bowed before an idol of an owl in the firelight
When I walked past a black mass last night

They began an incantation
Spoke a witchy spell
With words from Revelations
Of fire and war and hell
They laid a lamb there on the altar, then they raised that knife

I saw teachers, preachers, political leaders
Wear their mark of the beast
I saw CEO's take off their robes
And pray to a demon priest
And then they bared their bodies in a bloody sacrifice

But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

In days of old there lived a king
A king in England's country fair
In every forest, copse and glen
This king would take his royal share
Neither gentry fine their private lands
Not the common fields in common hands
Could e'er escape his roving eye
Bold Reynard and his kingly tithe

[Chorus]
And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

[Verse 2]
His coat of burnished amber made
Did shine like fire atop the hill
To put the golden sun to shame
As o’er his back he slung his kill
Though the huntsman's hounds did him pursue
Both brook and briar and bramble through
He yet retained his liberty
Bold Reynard still is roaming free
[Chorus]
And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

[Verse 3]
But time has passed and English hearts
No longer have the time nor care
For either forest, copse or glen
Of which Bold Reynard has his share
The city now spreads o’er the land
No common fields for common hands
And Reynard's fate is sore unkind
His kingdom now he leaves behind

And the bugle horn did merry cry
To sound the hunting call
Bold Reynard with his wit so fine
He did evade them all

So now our king his lands has lost
And swiftly comes his cruel demise
The cold dark streets his only realm
And table scraps his only prize
His fiery mane once royal cloak
Now turning grey with dust and smoke
As now he wanders door to door
And sips the morning dew no more

Over the hills with a creak in me sack

Catch your breath with every wave come crashing in
Ooo, got mixed emotions
Sure feels good to ride along that western wind
Hope it brings me back again
There's nothing like an ocean

[Verse 2]
These days, I still got miles to go
I keep running each day low
Sometimes I drive myself insane
Buses, cars, and planes
Nobody sees my face
Nobody knows my name
[Chorus]
Ooo, there's nothing like an ocean
Catch your breath with every wave come crashing in
Ooo, got mixed emotions
Sure feels good to ride along that western wind

Ooo, there's nothing like an ocean
Catch your breath with every wave come crashing in
Ooo, got mixed emotions
Sure feels good to ride along that western wind
Hope it brings me back again
There's nothing like an ocean
An ocean

[Outro]
Nothing like an ocean, an ocean
Nothing like an ocean, an ocean",country,Nothing Like An Ocean,0.5,-0.3,2007
