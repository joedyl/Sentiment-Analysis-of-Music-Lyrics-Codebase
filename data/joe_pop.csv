600,The Poodles,"The sun here is merciless
It beats upon my face like rain in the desert sand
The world is in a different shine
And my usual preferences do not rhyme

And this magic light I have seldom seen
Like a hidden treasure in a dream
I know that I am a stranger too
In this Shangri-la I reach for

You and all that you do
In starlit skies I ride with angels
You make it come true
Even though my bones are dry and torn
My pilot of the storm

Across the sea of years
Under blood red skies
We ride on the trail of tears

And this magic light I have seldom seen
Like a hidden treasure in a dream
I know that I am a stranger too
In this Shangri-la I reach for
You and all that you do
In starlit skies I ride with angels
You make it come true
Even though my bones are dry and
A bad moon rose when I was born
Now it's time to lose my crown of thorns
My pilot of the storm

If I summon all what I have learned
I sit and watch the pages burn
I know that I am a stranger too

603,Matthew Good Band,"It gets dark around here early
Sometimes the Moon, it follow you in the middle of the day
Waiting to be found, we were just standing around
With nothing really much to say

I didn't know any better
You didn't think that we should
Said we're gonna burn down the night
I wanna be misunderstood
All four wheels across the pavement
We used to live in black and white
I only think about tomorrow
So it'll get me through the night

And I ain't laughing
And I ain't joking anymore
I keep my footsteps to the ground
I keep my eyes glued to the floor
And somewhere in between
Only in the Stalin's dream
On this side of midnight
And maybe we're just crazy
Maybe we're better off dead
Maybe things will never change
Maybe you've got it backwards in your head
The last of the Ghetto Astronauts won't be ignored
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before

It gets dark around here early
Sometimes there's more to the Moon
Then just one man can see
The voice without a name
Cries silent just the same
Just the same way

If I didn't know any better
I'd say that maybe we all should
When the morning comes around
Don't wanna be misunderstood
Sleeping on the pavement
Thinking everything's all right
Waiting for tomorrow
To get us through tonight

And I ain't laughing
And I ain't joking anymore
I keep my footsteps to the ground
I keep my eyes glued to the floor

Been sleeping in a town without a name
Been holding on to your arms and legs, your arms and legs
'Cause nobody here wanna put you back together again
Together again, together again, together again

[Verse 2 - Andre]
Just got back from a summer trip
Felt so great, now my life feel like a sunk ship
As I go deeper and deeper 'till I can't feel shit
Not like anybody won't fuck with me when I can't quit
And no-show never miss
The flow switch hitting harder than the bass
Bumping on a park bench
Light a joint and pass it over just so I can feel shit, feel this
Now I come up to anybody and listen what they say
And saying whoa shit, can't do it like this
Writing lyrics I'm getting them to recite this
So many things that be fucking up my brain but despite this
You see the intellect see the worth I'm with my brightness
Shining like the light had to turn one on just to write this
Shining like the light but it's no need to light it to like this
If you try to take a hit at me just know you might miss
Master duck a motherfucker this is Andre, bitch
[Chorus - ATRA$HAD]

They will never understand

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

To peg your head with vegetables
And kick you in the testicles

And you’ll never be best in show

Remain calmest and abolish your modesty
‘Cause honestly you got to be positive, you’re a prodigy
You show the world that you’re not to mess with
It’s a broken home that makes these bastards aggressive

You can expect to get rejected
Neglected, stripped naked, and tested until they reckon
You feel terrible because nothing is comparable
Violence ain’t the answer but the pain is unbearable
You’re nice and jaded from being isolated
Now you coast through life feeling twice as hated
So why the abuse?

I'll kick it non-stop off the top of my head
But I didn't come to talk about the next man dead
If he try to test me or step to my crew
Cause I ain't the type of guy to pull a gun on you
So if a shot bust then you know it a fe lyrical
A DJ bakkle shouldn't get too physical
How you wan talk bout you style so original
When me hear that me a fe laugh so hysterical
Could list off your ripoffs in order categorical
Ya ridims, style and lyrics just copy from historical
But through me nah no pirate seh me so irresistable
And through me versatile Jah know me style so radical
Step tp the inimitable, the damage would be terrible
Sometimes I drop it literal, and other times in parable
Scientific fact is for every little act
There is an equal and opposite reaction

So when you kick a detraction and the bakkle in swing
I just siddung on top of the riddim like the king in a de ring
Whether live chanting or pon a recording
Love is all I bring
Inna me Ghanaian suit and ting
Love is all I bring
Inna me Wu Shu suit and ting
Let me reiterate, my sound reverberates
A long decay, four year delay on an infinite repeat
Can you feel the heat blasting out my furnace?
Don't try to spurn this
You know you can't burn this 'cause I earned this
Turn around, concern yourself with your own business
'Cause you when you dissed this with unrealistic expressions of prowess and prie
You know you lied
And now you can't hide from the tanning that's due you
I'm looking through you, so whatcha gonna do?

721,Paradox,"If I could rewind - the turning hands of time
Only progressing forwards on a constant speed
A pace without disgrace - right to infinity
We must go on without correction of our deeds
It sounds like irony - ""we all are free""
Captured by our past eternally
Those to me are fools - ""who try to change""
The facts of history
Like our acts of hate - which will never fade
Inside our memory like a secret haze
On the day we die - sins evade from inside
Never to fade - impossible to erase
It sounds like irony - ""we all are free""
Captured by our past eternally
Those to me are fools - ""who try to change""
The facts of history
That's why we feel - sadness...madness
So many tears we shed - a lake of tears
To wash the sins away - but they never disappear
Memories always coming through
Life does not forget the truth
Our ancestors accused - same us our children
They point their fingers at us (it's us) you were killing
Time is running out - to correct the direction
Is there only sadness left or time - for correction?
A possibility - ""that we are free""
To change fate with fantasy
We can make the rules ""change the lanes""
Away from hate - away from hate
Away from sadness...madness...",pop,Sadness,-0.5,0.3,2000

She would be too glad to see me cry
My life is low
I don't care who she might be with today
I guess I had to lose her anyway

I'm fine about her new life

739,Asobi Seksu,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand
Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
Haul on the bowline,"" we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they are far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons

Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line, saying, ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again

Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to ship

Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past
They asked me my name, and I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid",pop,Bob Dylans 115th Dream,-0.4,0.6,2010

Grow tight, no longer unfold

Bearings and rivers

Things decay, strength is
Forgotten in the face of weakness

You see the ladder getting shorter
You want to drink but when you try to drink

And every day you're crucified
If you can't look them in the eye
Smile and wave goodbye, nice try

Loneliness was all she knew
Because of her God sent beauty
Evil and carnage were sure to ensure
Her death was Conchobars duty
The high king Conchobar would not dare
So he did her away from his people
Deirdre will live and grow up fair
Then marry me in my temple

(18 yrs. Later)
She was disgusted by Conchobar
And vowed she would not be wed
I love only the man who bears the colours-
Black white and blood red
I know such man!,her aide explained
But Deirdre could only hope
Uisneach's sons were led to the forest
With Naoise, she would elope
No place was safe for the four exiles
They left Eireann with heavy hearts
But to see her face and see her smile
Gave the brothers strength to depart
In Albas' hills they made their home
And began a simple life
Local hatred had suddenly grown
Men wanted her as a wife

Conchobar dreamed of Deirdre his true love
He longed for the touch of her skin
His duties neglected, his life so affected
Why did she leave the court of the King?
After some time he explained he was wrong
Or so we were led to believe
This sorrowful song I have sung for too long
Naoise agus Deirdre I now forgive

Naoise always longed to go back home
When he heard the news he wept
The brothers prepared for the journey ahead
With Fergus Mac Roth they all left
The exiles returned to the King alone
And knew there was something not right
Conchobar made his plans be known
The brothers took up the fight
The exiles fled to the sorrowful forest
Foloowed by the king's men
Deirdre was hidden but they needed rest
They could not fight again
Naoise smelt death and he quietly said-
Please Deirdre stay where you are
A belt of a sword and the brothers fell dead
Deirdre smelt blood on the air

(Conchobar:)
Cannot you see, I did this for you
Our wedding can now take place
They left for Fern Mag, as the cold wind blew

Full moon, bedroom, stars in your eyes
Last night, the first time that I realized
The glow between us felt so right
We sat on the edge of the bed and you said
""I never knew that I could feel this way""
Love today can be so difficult
But what we have I know is different
'Cause when I'm with you the world stops turning

Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?
Could I love you any more?

Being close, inhaling, hard to believe

Finding you is like a miracle
Only this wonder remains

Could I love you any more?

A single wink makes all the fights stop
When I tie my little ribbon
The whole world will become one with Cinderella
The kind of girl that can make flowers blush
The kind of girl that can have you a little bit longer

Can I be next to you?

Are beginning to look different this time
