Pilot Of The Storm,pop,The Poodles,2009,152,{},"The sun here is merciless
It beats upon my face like rain in the desert sand
The world is in a different shine
And my usual preferences do not rhyme

And this magic light I have seldom seen
Like a hidden treasure in a dream
I know that I am a stranger too
In this Shangri-la I reach for

You and all that you do
In starlit skies I ride with angels
You make it come true
Even though my bones are dry and torn
My pilot of the storm

Across the sea of years
Under blood red skies
We ride on the trail of tears

And this magic light I have seldom seen
Like a hidden treasure in a dream
I know that I am a stranger too
In this Shangri-la I reach for
You and all that you do
In starlit skies I ride with angels
You make it come true
Even though my bones are dry and
A bad moon rose when I was born
Now it's time to lose my crown of thorns
My pilot of the storm

If I summon all what I have learned
I sit and watch the pages burn
I know that I am a stranger too
In this Shangri-La I reach for

You and all that you do
In starlit skies I ride with angels
You make it come true
Even though my bones are dry and torn

The Worst Is yet To Come,pop,Slut,2021,56,{},"[Verse 1]

Last of the Ghetto Astronauts,pop,Matthew Good Band,2015,93,{},"It gets dark around here early
Sometimes the Moon, it follow you in the middle of the day
Waiting to be found, we were just standing around
With nothing really much to say

I didn't know any better
You didn't think that we should
Said we're gonna burn down the night
I wanna be misunderstood
All four wheels across the pavement
We used to live in black and white
I only think about tomorrow
So it'll get me through the night

And I ain't laughing
And I ain't joking anymore
I keep my footsteps to the ground
I keep my eyes glued to the floor
And somewhere in between
Only in the Stalin's dream
On this side of midnight
And maybe we're just crazy
Maybe we're better off dead
Maybe things will never change
Maybe you've got it backwards in your head
The last of the Ghetto Astronauts won't be ignored
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before

It gets dark around here early
Sometimes there's more to the Moon
Then just one man can see
The voice without a name
Cries silent just the same
Just the same way

If I didn't know any better
I'd say that maybe we all should
When the morning comes around
Don't wanna be misunderstood
Sleeping on the pavement
Thinking everything's all right
Waiting for tomorrow
To get us through tonight

And I ain't laughing
And I ain't joking anymore
I keep my footsteps to the ground
I keep my eyes glued to the floor
And somewhere in between
Only in the Stalin's dream
On this side of midnight
And maybe we're just crazy
Maybe we're better off dead
Maybe things will never change
Maybe you've got it backwards in your head
The last of the Ghetto Astronauts won't be ignored
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before
Said I'm gonna go where no one has gone before

Been walking with the giants
Been sleeping in a town without a name
Been holding on to your arms and legs, your arms and legs
'Cause nobody here wanna put you back together again
Together again, together again, together again

And maybe we're just crazy
Maybe we're better off dead
Maybe things will never change
Maybe you've got it backwards in your head

I try to make sense of these feelings
Most have no reason or rhyme

Torn up and left to blow away
Brittle and soft is the illusion

No I won’t be used
I will not surrender
Just trying to remember
What it feels like to be loved

Each time I’m faced with something new

To try to make your heart confused
Waves come crashing like a fever
Sucking the life out of midair
Seems that nature’s course is futile
A hurricane one’s soul cannot bear

Give time to breathe
Time to laugh
Time to see. Time

Can't be held responsible for what you didn't say

This hand that's sliding down my leg

When you touched me there
You're starting something that I'll finish

They call that ""retrospect""

I see the person that you are, the one I never knew
Do you ever feel me anymore or are you too high?

Some ancient Druid was pursuant to ruin your life
With a curse but worse, he brought his whole damn crew in

And now it’s high noon and you’re a target to shoot at
This school’s a battlefield, no wonder you’re truant
They always look at you and they boo at what you’re doing
And you go off like a bomb at the Olympics in Munich

Nah, you’re just an extraterrestrial

You’re just a jester at the festival

To peg your head with vegetables
And kick you in the testicles
And best of all let you know that you’re a filthy dog
And you’ll never be best in show

I’ma be honest, it gets better, I promise
So don’t let them ground you down to a pound of sawdust
Stay on the stage the longest ’til the gong hits and everybody comments
On their fondness of your polish and your overall knowledge

Remain calmest and abolish your modesty
‘Cause honestly you got to be positive, you’re a prodigy
You show the world that you’re not to mess with
It’s a broken home that makes these bastards aggressive

You can expect to get rejected
Neglected, stripped naked, and tested until they reckon
You feel terrible because nothing is comparable
Violence ain’t the answer but the pain is unbearable
You’re nice and jaded from being isolated
Now you coast through life feeling twice as hated
So why the abuse?
‘Cause all a bully needs is another excuse

On a cold winter's day
Waved goodbye to my best friend

I found out there was only one thing

Has turned to black
Darkened clouds beneath
The astral stars
As the winds fly through
With wings so dark
A deep storming sea
With griefull past

I touch the grief, feel the pain
Taste the sorrow, before the dawn

The seagull fly in circles
Over an open sea
A morning again has risen
With silver tears
At the shore of a dreadful baltic
I touch the stones as the water
Echoes your name
Here I stand all alone
Themendous pain freeze inside
The sun sets slowly
Cold and silent

In a void where candles burn

More than love or friendship true
This destiny will bring on anew

An end to stories and legends of old

Dreaming over and over of you

Known from cutting, drinking, drugs and depression
Masking pain, lost in frustration

I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand
Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
Haul on the bowline,"" we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they are far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons

Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around saying, ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line, saying, ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again

Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to ship

Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past
They asked me my name, and I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid",1628122,en,en,en

Forgotten in the face of weakness

My little brother by my side

Always a friend where I could hide
But who am I to never reach for an answer
So here I am out there tonight

I want to speak but when I try to speak
It doesn't help the situation

And some, they fly while others fall
And some, they walk while others crawl

You see the ladder getting shorter
You want to drink but when you try to drink

Says the spider to the fly, nice try

And every day you're crucified
If you can't look them in the eye

Exiles,pop,Cruachan,2002,41,{},"(Music: KF, JF Words: KF)

Loneliness was all she knew
Because of her God sent beauty
Evil and carnage were sure to ensure
Her death was Conchobars duty
The high king Conchobar would not dare
So he did her away from his people
Deirdre will live and grow up fair
Then marry me in my temple

(18 yrs. Later)
She was disgusted by Conchobar
And vowed she would not be wed
I love only the man who bears the colours-
Black white and blood red
I know such man!,her aide explained
But Deirdre could only hope
Uisneach's sons were led to the forest
With Naoise, she would elope
No place was safe for the four exiles
They left Eireann with heavy hearts
But to see her face and see her smile
Gave the brothers strength to depart
In Albas' hills they made their home
And began a simple life
Local hatred had suddenly grown
Men wanted her as a wife

Conchobar dreamed of Deirdre his true love
He longed for the touch of her skin
His duties neglected, his life so affected
Why did she leave the court of the King?
After some time he explained he was wrong
Or so we were led to believe
This sorrowful song I have sung for too long
Naoise agus Deirdre I now forgive

Naoise always longed to go back home
When he heard the news he wept
The brothers prepared for the journey ahead
With Fergus Mac Roth they all left
The exiles returned to the King alone
And knew there was something not right
Conchobar made his plans be known
The brothers took up the fight
The exiles fled to the sorrowful forest
Foloowed by the king's men
Deirdre was hidden but they needed rest
They could not fight again
Naoise smelt death and he quietly said-
Please Deirdre stay where you are
A belt of a sword and the brothers fell dead
Deirdre smelt blood on the air

(Conchobar:)
Cannot you see, I did this for you
Our wedding can now take place
They left for Fern Mag, as the cold wind blew
In a chariot she felt deaths embrace
I am Deirdre, for a short time alive

Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

City sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every
Street corner you'll hear

[Chorus]
Strings of street lights
Even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all
This bustle you'll here

Cause you always seem to be sticking around
The pressure is rising and I'm 'bout to drown
I thought you said that
It would be better if I didn't look
But I smile back and maybe I took
This all for granted

But now you're here in my arms
The room is cold, you set alarms
But I've been running from you my whole life

[Verse 2 - Parrotfish]
Cause I have been losing all faith in myself
I have been trying to get off the shelf
I needed to
But I'm getting scared, I can't do it alone
And I'm just so nervous when I lose my phone
I can't get through

Filled with indecision all the time
But now you're here in my arms

Lately I haven't been doing a lot
The clothes on my floor have been piling up
I can't walk through
Forget what I said about being alone
I hate this shit and I wanna go home
Be next to you
Cause happy times only make missing you worse
I'm not losing hope I'm just hoping this works
Well, don't you too?

I need an exorcism
And I don't need extra drugs
Bro, I'm really failing
And I don't need a fucking hug
I need some repetition
When I said I gave a fuck
I swear that I was kidding
Drove by my old apartment
Let's be real, that shit was ours
But after you departed
Spent my money on the bars
And cigars with some weed
Uber cars, with just me
Your new boy thinks you love him
But you told that shit to me

Filled with indecision all the time

Beyond the limits of my mortal mind
Where grace abounds and love is blind

We were movin fast
Held up by spare tires
Old enough to know
Young enough not to care
I was hungry and lean
Too dumb to be scared
I wasn't looking for trouble
But trouble found me
I told you what I wanted
You gave me what I need
I'm pretty little girl
Three days from eighteen
I said damn you look good to me

So let's get stoned
Turn the radio up
Know it sure felt good
No I wouldn't call it love
Your blonde hair fallin' long
Covered up my eyes
Night's just comin' on
Ain't gotta rush home
Baby, let's get stoned
Things I didn't know
Were too long to list
She was my first everything
Oh sweet innocence
Summer time comes
I still think of her now
Long legs wrapped in mine
With the moon comin' out
There was thunder in the darkness
We were both achin'
Restless for the contact
My hands shakin'
But she's on my mind
I'm still seventeen
Sayin' damn you look good to me

So let's get stoned
Turn the radio up
I know it sure felt good
No I wouldn't call it love
Your blonde hair fallin' long
Covered up my eyes
Night's just comin' on
Ain't gotta rush home
Baby, let's get stoned
Oh!
So let's get stoned
Turn the radio up
I know it sure felt good
No I wouldn't call it love
Your blonde hair fallin' long
Covered up my eyes
Night's just comin' on
Ain't gotta rush home

Can you do me a favor?

Passing through the chocolate forest
Hopped on an orange pumpkin carriage
That will for sure take me away
Toward the milk-colored castle

Everyone wants to be a heroine
Showing up in such fairytales
I ever saw in my sleep
A pair of glass high heels

My secret and true feelings
I'll tell you all about them

So I'll be a new me, if you please

I want to be cute like that girl
Let me try on a frilly dress
The only one Cinderella in the world
A bit of courage and bigger first shots
Perhaps I might be trembling in fear
I want to be a girl
Can you do me a favor?
Can you let me be cute?

Whatever I do, whatever I try

Even for an instant
I feel like if a little bit
I'm going to change

So nervous and excited
That I can't sleep at night

The entrance to the fairytale is right there

Give it a glance and the sun will rise
A single wink makes all the fights stop
When I tie my little ribbon
The whole world will become one with Cinderella
The kind of girl that can make flowers blush
The kind of girl that can have you a little bit longer
I want to be a girl like that
Can I be next to you?

Things that were meant to be sharp and clear
Are beginning to look different this time

So I'll be a new me, if you please

After all, I want to be cute
I want to be cute like that girl
With a little tilt of my head
This time I'm gonna be Cinderella

Hiding in the corner when today matters a lot

I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete(so complete)
While you handlin' me this way, what was it?
You was talkin yesterday, yesterday, I could say
I seemed to be so complete, so complete

You didn't, no kiss, no lovin'
You didn't, it's a shame

You didn't, share things I wan'na see
You didn't, when ever your around me it's so complete

I still belive, that it was supposed to be

We can feel the desert winds blow

Another month, another year
Another drink, another tear

Where the reason is strong
And the logic is weak
I just wanna be me, me

What else could I be?

We will cry, we will try
Pain is always a passing-by
And I'll watch you while you sleep

Burning bridges and taking out the trash

Just what I should say
To someone who's guts I couldn't stand
One more day

I'm the worst
Person that you've
Ever been cursed
To meet
And I know that you
Probably wish
I were pushing daisies
Through a ditch
But I've changed my tune
Walking along I wondered
Just who I knew
With enough pent up anger to beat someone
Black and blue
Then it came to me like a light bulb overhead
I know that you want at least one person dead
I went abroad for awhile
Learned how to say please
And say thank you
Fell in with a kindly old yogi
He had lots of good things to show me
I feel that I'm almost enlightened
Still I want to bash this guy's head in
I thought maybe you could arrange it
'Cause my new state won't allow it
Now
Lying around I wondered just who I could get
To help me have this big jerk that I know knee-capped
And then it hit me exactly like a lightning strike
You're full of rage and probably spoiling for a fight
I know that you think
I'm the worst
Person that you've
Ever been cursed
To meet
And I know that you
Probably wish
I were pushing daisies
Through a ditch
But I've changed my tune
Strolling along I wondered just how to ask
If you'd consider maybe kicking that dude's ass
I think I know what would make it real easy
You could pretend that that dude's ass is me

Sorrier still I laughed so hard like that
Sorry that my old drug connection
Busted up your Hummel collection
Sorry I showed up at your old job

Hoping that the problems happen to someone else...

Dem controlin the war!
In their fancy suits and with their money off-shore
Plotting amongst them the ways of getting some more
Bigger the confusion, more the things get hardcore

Everyday them liars!
Mal formation, information, feed us, bad fires!
Missed communication from these nation vampires!
Puppets on no string, instead we have the barbed wires!
Wanna beat them!
It's a serious situation
Youth are packing guns, instead of picking playstations
Ride into the gang and start to build them foundations
For a life of crime, and full of low expectations

Don’t you worry ‘bout my safety
If I ever get in trouble
I’ll just run and shout ALLONS-Y

Still got some running left to do
I’ll run to you…

And simply fascinating
It was you…
I found love inside that box of blue;
And so did you…

If it’s my last chance now to tell you true
That I’ve wanted to say this for some time…
Please don’t forget me now
Don’t cry…

Oh! It’s what you’ve done to me!
Oh, across the galaxies…
Oh, it’s what you’ve done to me!
Oh, you and your BAD WOLF tendencies…

I’d walk 500 miles for you
500 more, and when I’m through
I’d fall down at your door and then I’d say…

Rose Tyler there’s not time enough
To tell you all the ways I think you’re brilliant
And I’ve missed you since that day…
Rose Tyler I can promise you
That I’d break time and space for you
The universe will remember your name!

I’m on my way!

Hey there Rose Tyler
You be good and don’t you miss me
You’ve got TenToo now to help you through
But I can’t re-write hist’ry
Not this time

There’s nothing I would rather do…

Die in motion

A thousand sides
A million lies

Find and cancel the cause
Kill determination take back what we've lost

Fight power and lies

Twilight interventions combine with undefined melancholy
You never figured one could fall so deep
Without ground in sight

If your intention is to defy the dark
Be prepared to step into the flames of damnation
Behind the walls of doom
You'll expect to meet your ""saviour""
Or all hopes of remedy will disintegrate forever

If I'm unable to find such, why not try the opposite?
When there's light and salvation, there needs to be darkness
And in the dark, I now want to wander recklessly.""

And he puts some little water bottles on the patio
Where I burn my cigarettes when he's not around
When I burn, when he's not around

And maybe if that dying flower finds life again there is no
Not me, all the flowers I give you are stolen and dying

I would throw my hands around them
And squeeze them till there was no hope

I do not worry about you

And everything that once was warm and new is gone now

The Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed
It was shady eyes with the violent noise
We on the graveyard digging where the love is void
We had a meltdown underground
Just a cemetery chick, but it's over now
But I still taste your bones when I’m all alone
You’re the best I ever had, but now you’ve got to go
And now I’m on my own
I said, “Please don’t go.”
Please don’t go

Spoken alphabet soup
Drivel slop, can't chew
On all fours on the floor
Wail until primer become sore

Teething thoughts that make you scream
Holler mad until we feel detach
Hug it out then we come right back
Hear me out, need some comforting

Earthworm Jim Stage by staged, no white hand man
Play by played, guess the issues too bland
Esoteric in nature Stature of dirty man with no paper
Creator, eyes of a dult but teenager
All needs balance but damn I'm such waiter

Tried it twice before but the notepad lack the labor

Built a fence to stay mute
Always with them grabby hands
Never was the type to point at you

Look at me I'm starving dude I would've snapped your apple

Holey like some sponges

The Kappa,pop,Momus,2015,48,{},"Be careful by the river when a kappa is about
He’s a folk monster, a hairy kind of lout
Scaly like a reptile, smaller than a man
With green webbed feet, a salamander hand

He swims like a fish but the kappa smells dead
A flat wet plate on the pate of his head
Which must stay wet or the kappa grows weak
Sharp little teeth, a nose like a beak

Human children are his favourite food
Aubergines and cucumbers are just as good
Remember that the kappa can irrigate land
Help you with the harvest when you need a hand

And even at his worst, at the height of his attack
If you bow to a kappa he always bows back

Totally unprincipled but outwardly polite
He’s a folk monster and a rapist on the side
He lurks down by the river fingering kimonos
So a naked pearl diver should never go solo
For a kappa may be lurking on the bottom of the lake
Ready to accost and impregnate
And soon a little folk monster will be born
Bury it at once or the kappa will return

If you have to fight you’ll win if you can get
The arms off his body or the water off his head
Remember that the kappa can bring you fish
Reset your bones if you ever break a wrist

And even at his worst, at the height of his attack
If you bow to a kappa he always bows back",2261328,en,en,en

Tell my friends that I’m sorry I can’t be

I’m out of breath, but I will push to go further
My journey’s begun and there’s no time to recover
No time to sleep, I toss and turn if I do
I’m on the path and aiming straight with the truth
I take off my shoes so I can go up quicker
I promise myself that I will always deliver
Sometimes I'll fall and maybe sometimes maybe I'll bruise
I know where I'm going, I’m no longer confused

Pipe dreams, far away plans
Suddenly here in the palm of my hand
Tick, tock, now I’m ready to stand
Living in a fairytale that I command

Turning to dust, I’m barely touching the ground
Run for all that you ache for
Running like thunder without making a sound
Faster, I’m going faster
Turning to dust, I’m barely touching the ground
Run for all that you ache for
Running like thunder without making a sound

Closing my eyes to say a prayer, yes another
No voice to tell me I’m living in the clouds

Back up your plans and catch the train to discover
Perfectly place your hopes and then you will see

I promise myself what I can do
I will try harder if only for you
I’m right on the edge

Violet Dreams,pop,Dave Davies,2015,28,{},"Violet dreams caress my eyes and my heart cries out to you
Gently peace will flow in and out of you so we're all far from you

Funny how it goes
There's a plan that's finally found a home
We can seek another course
Now we can open up life's golden doors

Broken schemes are turned in the earth that supports and gives life to you
Gently in each wind that blows hides a voice of truth calling to you but..

We know that you haven't got the time
To listen to each heart that beats with yours
And my future dances us closer ever now
We can only try away from earth

True these foolish ways, we know that we should change
But we see all life's a miracle and a life that doesn't age
We just fancy we remember but your memory remains
You're part of me, I'm part of you, wherever we go
Sweet dream like a rose will grow in the very heart of you
Someday love will come and the world will change and then we can be ..

Free any time at all
We will recognize and bare the souls
When you decide to come along
Violet dreams will tempt your aching soul

Gently peace will flow in and out of you and forever be",1625675,en,en,en

Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Doing it real good
Everybody knowing it
Like they know they should
Shiny sabres rattling
Long into the night
And everybody saying it
Saying what they like

There are words there to be heard
Maybe none of them will fire you
But none the less they will make you listen by force

From every place on high
Everybody loving it
Loving what they find
There's blood upon each handshake
Lies upon each word
And everybody killing it
Killing off what's good

Between the haves and who have nots

That lay beyond the reservation road
He said don't make promises that you won't keep
Don't betray the earth beneath your feet
As we walked on the reservation road

Chorus:
And just for that one moment we were racing with the wind
And sound of horses thundering they echoed once again
Back to a place where our hearts and souls belong
A thousand dreams away from that reservation road
A thousand dreams away from that reservation road

Then his spirit soared into the sky
Beyond the place where eagle fly
And my tears fell on the reservation road

Now a hundred moons have come and gone
And I'm holding on to my newborn son
One day he'll walk on the reservation road
Chorus:
And just for that one moment we were racing with the wind
And sound of horses thundering they echoed once again

He was pointing to the promised land
That lay beyond the reservation road
It went way beyond the reservation road

Benjamins Giant Onion,pop,Stackridge,1975,97,{},"In Beeding-on-Wold a sight to behold

Risk life and limb for no one
Some men bounce around in spacesuits on the moon
But Ben grows onions instead

Come rain or come shine he spends all his time
And energy nursing his pride and joy
The lady next door can’t stand any more
It's driving her out of the neighbourhood

Now Ben's life is ruled by onions (What a shame!)
His clothes they reek of fertiliser
All his family are leaving (Fancy that!)
But Ben is blind to it all

Take heed from Ben onions sent him right round the bend
Take care my friends the onion doesn't get you in the end

His onions grow down on the funny farm Come rain or come shine he spends all his time

I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign
I'm happy for you
But now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
I'm on my empty bed
At night the fever grows it's pounding, pounding

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
And watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo

Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed
And I was home in bed
I was a kid again

Jesus told me go after every coin like it was the last in the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
You know I need my shepherd here tonight
Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
I'm wondering how things could've been

I'd like to see you
But, really, I should stay away
And let you settle down (Let you settle down)
I've got no claims to your crown (Let you settle down)
I was the boss of you and I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now

And I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were bad (There when you were bad)
I was there when you were sad (There when you were sad)
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh

There's giving more

And taller then

See, in my hometown there's a lotta homegrown, quick to bone if left alone

Made a mockery of myself, it's a tragedy, lucky didn't end up with a pregnancy
So don't be like Mr. Sad Ding Dong, when you dip better wrap your shlong
Some think it's funny, got no money, a coupla kids but they mouth still runny
Ssstop and asses the situation, the train left but you still at the station
Don't be stupid, and if you're in doubt just go home and rub one out!
But if you're too horny, to just say no, don't come cryin to me to hear I told you so

Broken Boy,pop,Mark Tulk,2014,3,{},"[Verse 1]

From the darkness of this soul
You called the holy [?]

That ancient light has faded

Anymore

[Verse 2]
You always seemed so angry
You never gave me your time
You knew your friend abused me
But never thought to call it a crime
Some secrets can be tamed
But others knock you to the floor
I used to speak to my father
But don't seem to
Anymore

What Is Knowledge,pop,Rielle & Brianna,2018,51,{},"Our world is just a darkened cave
With chains and shadows we obey
Don’t trust anything
We prisoners believe it’s true
Because we’ve always been told to
But we must break free

Whether you take the red pill or the blue pill
Don’t be afraid to question what is real
There’s no spoon, don’t be fooled they’re all illusions
Be Morpheus in a world of Agent Smiths

Our senses are deceiving us
It’s all a dream what can we trust?
We really can’t be certain that we’re real
I think therefore I am, that’s true
Rene Descartes thinks we’re all fools
For trusting God, who may just be evil
Am I just a voice in someone else’s head?

Step into Nozick’s machine
Any experience you dream
The perfect life awaits you
Would you chose to walk away
Or live fake reality
What is happiness?
Are humans born tabula rasa?
Locke says innate knowledge be damned
What you learn always comes from first hand experience
Don’t worry Locke will teach you step by step

Knowledge is always fleeting
Are you sure the grass is green
If you cannot see each blade all the time
Sense experience is real
But when you disengage the once
Vivid impression just fades away
Ideas are weak, and there is no certainty

Use your knowledge, ideas innate
Your learning is in your control
Just interact and see
Physics packets, you teach yourself
Like throwing your kids in the pool
Trust me they’ll learn to swim
Because the abilities to learn
Already exist in you

This knowledge got me straight confused
All the philosophers argue
But Kant shut that shit down with just four words
Synthetic a priori knowledge!
A combination of it all
The possibility of the
Experience can lead to the
A priori concepts that we
Conceive
Kant could’ve been the end of philosophy",3626545,en,en,en

Extirpation of the heathen
Cast into the infinite holocaust

Nation will rise against nation
Famines wage war on the land

Hidden from the insane minds

They hear but understanding can't find

Their eyes they willfuly seal
Otherwise their eyes might see

You play the game but you’re hard to tame

You’ve got your gloves on but you can’t fight

And when there’s nothing left to love

Find belief in wanderlust

Leading me on no reveal it seems

Deep down below under your liquid skin

Far beneath in the abysmal sea
An ancient, dreamless uninvaded sleep
Becomes the stillness of the central sea

To show you something different every day

Shocking, ain't it?

And that's grinding my gears
How can a human lose their self-control?

Leave it to somebody else

They hung an air raid siren, began their hiring with some posters in the town hall
I said I'd never held a gun, didn't know much at all
They said that's common… it's much too common

Where would we be, refusing to fight?
A bombed-out village in the middle of the night
I've never left this town before
But goodbye Bedford Falls, hello war

Billy Mann has a farm on the edge of town
He can grow anything to be fit for the King, but he can't put that bottle down
Since his two sons died, he's had his share of sorrow to drown
But I guess that's common… yeah, it is

Susie Morro has a job at the general store
There's a room in the back, where her little boy Jack is playing soldiers at ten to four
She's got a husband on a foreign shore
Around here, that's common… it's much too common
Where would we be, refusing to fight?
A bombed-out village in the middle of the night
What did we do, to deserve this cause?
We're just part of a race with some pretty big flaws
I'm not asking what it's all for
But goodbye Bedford Falls
Goodbye Bedford Falls, hello war

There's a message headed home to Bedford Falls
Susie's husband died while his beautiful bride taught their son to catch a ball
He won't remember his father much at all
But I guess that's common… it's much too common

Where would we be, refusing to fight?
A bombed-out village in the middle of the night
What did we do, to deserve this cause?
We're just part of a race with some pretty big flaws
Will the world remember the lives we give
Or the endless pain of the ones who still live?
If ever there was a town worth dying for

I've never been more happy Than at this place and time
I used to be so selfish With all that I owned
But it cost me so dearly; Even broke up my home

But I thank my Savior For a new lease on life
And weep tears of joy Just to call you my wife
And from all that I've learned, I know what to do
Take all that I am And give it to you

All of my hopes, All of my dreams
All of my plans, All of my schemes
All of my doubts, All of my fears
All of my love, Through all the years
Though great or small, I give it all
To you

Kneeling at this altar, My heart in Your hands
Dear Lord, I surrender This broken man
I've been so lonely; Jesus, You know
About all the sorrow That I can't let go
Savior, I need You More than I need breath
And I know You love me; You loved me to death
Lord God, that tells me What I need to do
Take all that I am And give it to You

All of my hopes, All of my dreams
All of my plans, All of my schemes

It's the man who's only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original, but doesn't notice it. Even in social life, you never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking what sort of impression you make. That principle runs all through life from the top to the bottom.

Our boots hit the ground and they scatter away
They fall all around like they've made a mistake
And what have we done to keep up the charade?
Can never go home, we're all one and the same
We get off our horses of metal and shame
Step over the masses who whisper our name
Restrain all our voices and swallow the pain
Deadly and gorgeous, we're coming through
We're comin' for you

I'm Penn, you might think I'm sweet
I've got a secret so cold and hard to keep
Nobody knows where to find my family
They've gone missing, it's because of me
And like Ace, I have nowhere to sleep
So we roam on the road with the other three
Feeling old and alone though we're young and free
Nowhere to go and no home cause they're scared of me
Listen, Miss Vixen
To your cold heart knockin', it's your heart blockin' and
Scarlett, you're fixin'
All the holes where life should be, what do your eyes see?
[Chorus]
True, we are vicious
Though we never intended to be malicious
True, we're all in this
Ban out the boring and repetitious
Yes, we're suspicious
So we leave no trace when our job is finished
We are listless, as we tear away

Heavy gets the leather
The blurs of cities
Together we've fought wars in our heads
So many more
Our real casualties
Bring us at ease
Just another way to go
None of us have any goals
No need to be wealthy or recover our time
'Cause Bloodlip flies
In their own skies

True, we are vicious
Though we never intended to be malicious
True, we're all in this
Ban out the boring and repetitious
Yes, we're suspicious
So we leave no trace when our job is finished
We are listless, as we tear away

Would I even say

Here in this airless space
No one to plead your pitiful case

Self-indulgence or a brilliant madness
All I know is I dying for air

Swimming just below the waves
I can see the sky
Looking darkly through the haze
The moon is drifting by
Then someone cuts the anchor
And slowly up I rise
An unwelcome guest in your home
That comes to stay and never wants goes
Not some much shadow but visitation
A haunting foreign movie with no translation

There's buzzing white noise in my head
Then sometimes so silent I'm almost dead
One true thing I hold to dear and fast
Is a voice that whispers
""Darlin' this too will pass""
Even when I'm dying for air

Swimming just below the waves

Looking darkly through the haze
The moon is drifting by

And get ourselves a drink

Not getting far
No, this town ain't much for starting off

And later when I'm walking underneath the starless sky
There's a couple in a doorway
And I think I hear them cry
But they turn their heads
When I go by

People scatter everywhere

Is better left unsaid

When they left you for dead?
I will have my vengeance soon
I will leave you seeing red
Everything falls in place
Once I have your head

KINGFISHER GIRL The Song of“Wish You Were Here”,pop, (Maaya Sakamoto),2003,129,"{""坂本真綾 (Maaya Sakamoto)""}","This is the song of a kingfisher girl
Who sits by the side of the River of Life
And flies in her mind over seven sad seas
Fiery her wings as so brightly she sings

Songs that are mystic, exotically tuned
--Songs that I sing to you

Sing, sing, sing out this song
Let it be heard all over the world

Cry, cry, cry silver tears
This is the song of ""Wish You Were Here""

Who dives in the waters of love's diamond depths
Who catches the fish that swim all through her blood
Sensually shining to taste on the tongue

The taste of dark honey that drips from the sun
The taste on these lips where all spices are spun
--Ever, eternally... on...

Let it be heard all over the world

Its sweet like honey, when I die its gon' taste like the Ramen
Ramen that I used to eat on Tuesdays, fuck what you make
Climbing up the ladder, this is Doomsday, where the crew stay
Signs of pitty patter from the crusade, thats a touché
Lines of ""whats the matter"" from my roommate, nothing to say
As I wake up from my dream, this shit ain't what it seems
A song to take up on thе screen, then you should've just seen
The look that brought up on thе scene, man it wasn't so keen
It shook him up, the certain thing that it wasn't so clean
He was writing lyrics just to make the people hear it
Despite the fearing, it was too fake, didn't put sincere in

I take a gamble on life with a pair of dice for paradise
And since its not making cents, its really hard to pay the price
And then I figured out that there's no second chances
I skipped out on heaven to chill where the devil dances
To only see that that demons that were haunting me was self inflicted pain that was given' to me mentally
So I, started to smoke it away
Thought it was a clear escape and kept telling myself that ""it's okay""
But as these blunts keep getting rolled up
I keep getting shortness of breath and my words get choked up
I might as well not put myself through this abysmal hell
The only thing I want in life is to prevail
To tell my grandchildren all of my greatest tails

Im high but not too high to not see the devil in a blue dress
With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity

Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street
I promote change but not the type to act strange
Change to better yourself and do better things

You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

The noose of life struggles will choke you
The hatred and envy of enemies will provoke you

So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole

[Verse 1 : Hailey B]
I remember the first time I had laid eyes
Black with the white stripe, the 1969 type
Late drives in the night time
White walls with them bright headlights, them headlights
Never have I ever wanted something so bad
I was ready to sell everything that I had
Just to sit in that car, dreams of driving really far
Driving out to see the sunset and the stars
And the stars always shine so bright
I never wanted to ever see the daylight
Driving coast to coast, love of my life to my right
Wind flowing just right, everything was alright, alright
But when that sun rise, everything was still right
That night I found the real love of my life
The white 2005 Camaro, Double blue stripe
My model 10 years later, and that’s perfectly fine

I remember the first time I had laid eyes
Blonde hair with the blue eyes
The ""fuck me over and I’ll fuck you up” type
Yeah I like that, I can really dig that, I think I really like that
Once have I ever wanted something more bad
I was ready to give you everything that I had
And all I had was my love, and you were like a drug
A couple henny shots, and I was already fucked
Up on your love, nicotine and weed could do no good
But then again who really could? Who could love like I would?
Never gave me the proper chance to really prove to you
I was watcha needed too, look at me, now look at you
Look at the way I look at you
Looking for love, but iIm stuck here looking for you
Boy oh boy what should I do? What should I do, I still got more to prove, but to who?

I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region

Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee

Traditional medicinal sentences, fresh quotes
And facts brought to back block against the trash talk
Blast off when my 10 toes touch the asphalt
Fast walk through the forest of flash floss and gloss
Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears

Wish someone told me who I was, back in highschool, yeah, yeah (in highscool)
Oh, I got caught up in my head and now life's cruel, yeah (fuck life)
I can't sleep, I can't dream
Let me breathe; trapped in memories
I can't eat, I'll just weep
Guess I killed who I used to be
I'm a mess, I'm fucked up
Yeah, the slut wasted all my love
Got straight A's, all I was
But who am I once highschools up?

We were told how we should be; now we live in disbelieve
Of the people that we meet, so we stick to memories
And your parents aren't in love; we have holes inside our hearts
Things will end up in th past; the pain ain't meant to last

Moved out west; still searching for something
Took a year for me to stop running
And all my friends, they love who I found and
Will stick with me until the end

Things change, but I won't forget
Ain't nobody used to check up on me when my thoughts collapsed and

Rock the boat, shipping like its #ziam
We're fucking sad so she cries on my dick
I'ma cry in her pussy and sniffle those inner lips
Lay under stars and we talk about the universe
Mentioned God and it made the conversation worse
But tell me this, how does conversation work?
Tired voice, so she think that I was sipping purp
My parents probably unaware of half the shit I do
But I guess I spilled the tea on the track, oops
There's some things that I guess will never change in you

I'd still fuck Jennifer Lawrence if she want me to
I'd still fuck Emma Stone if she want me to
I'd still fuck Ella Marija if she want me to

Wondering if I'll have some kids and call 'em mine

I'm a dead man
She so cut throat
Out of love though
Where’d my luck go

Oh, This life is beautiful
With you in my peripheral (Ohhhh)
And your love is critical
Do you want to leave me miserable? (Ohhh)

I need the high to stay

Feel like a holiday
Made 2k today
You got by today
Oh and by the way
Are you on the way
I just need Bentley just to get by
Codeine just to get high

Fuck it, I’m an asshole
Can I get you back?

On baby, can you give me the Franklin's?
Make her rain on her naked
Cocaine lit, got me higher than raises
I'm gonna need your location
Can I pull up?
Get ready to take dick
You won't need a replacement
Praying for the better
All these xans got me worse though

You don’t have no remorse though
Play me like it’s sports though

Verse One
(William Pippins)


What's a day from sycamore avenue?
Was babbling mumbling verbs I gotta prove
Like science fair’s on the day that’s due, Stupid kids
Was roaming these neighborhood’s funny we know
The outcome of crime guess God gave us a conscious too
So The only way to fly out the block was to be Lebron and
Pray to God that one day these new casters would come
They Casper see they didn’t show up we traded Spaulding for guns
And trapping keys like we stacking bricks on my mommas lawns
My Homie in the cell doing time like Rolex watch, The only things
That matters to him to watch the clocks, reminiscing on patience
Them day you didn’t know hatred, phone chirping from girls so when
You had they digits you made it, Pillow talks from this lil momma
She said was-sup? The Lust burning like the flames of the Hebrew
Boys in the furnace
Holy spirit speaking son yield, we was supposed to link at 5
I missed my ride that day her house got shot inside, God’s Will

Verse Two
(Demo Freeman)

I Never graduated from college
To earn a simple degree
I rather obtain my knowledge
From cook-in workin these streets
Man its obvious my fathers figure
Were nothin but drug dealers
With more bread than jiffy like its homemade cornbread
Momma said
Don’t you run mouth
Unless you run this house
I guess i'm running out
Packing my bags
Gather my cash
I’m ducking my stepdad
Because his tendencies
Is to close to my last dad
Got war in my heart
Life like its bagdad
Lord knows my empty soul is captivated by things that keep me enslaved
To wanting to be So famous
But little do i know
That my soul was jus on the ropes
And i'm fighting to keep it close
Cuz these demons want me to fold
My heart is growing so cold
Look down
Pick up my phone
A message coming from God, its ringing i pray i answer and won't deny",4025987,en,en,en

Just cryin and runnin
Ain't had no meanin
Started dreaming
And when I couldn't reach em
A nigga started schemin
I had to believe and
Find my own reason
Tho many chose treason
I chose to keep it
I came up by the east side
But I never chose sides
They ain't never know why
But I ain't never know my
Roots to begin
Who to befriend
So I chose to be great
Yea I chose to be him
Ridin through the ends
Eyeing through these lens
Looking at the faces
The ones say dey my friends
Is it all pretend
To meet what ends?
I'm feelin like what gives
But I guess that's how it is
When you came up by the
I came up by the east side
Right off edgerton
I remember I was cold alone with no friends
I was way up out the way side snowed in
Nowhere that I belong
Nowhere to call my home
I was right there by the east side
Off edgerton
I remember I was down bad
No ends
I just had to make a way I
Didn't wanna live that way
I will never live that way

I knew that I was different
Since the elementary
I used to see the mirror
And wish that i could switch it
This was my position
And nobody would listen
They never saw me fall
So I had to stop slippin
I had to make a choice
To get it or accept
So much poison in the air
I ain't wanna take a breath
And at times I would be scared
But I never chose death
In a game with no ref
I played the cards I was dealt
I had to play the field
Get it how I live
I could never keep a friend
I ain't even have a cent
But I had to to use my wits
Had to use my common sense
And with everyone I met
I though what they want outta this
Now I'm coast to coast building up to world wide
Naw I won't answer the phone
For any of the old ties
Ye ain't on what I'm on
Don't want talk of old times
You stay on yo side
And I'll stay on mine
Somewhere distant from the east side
I came up by the east side
Right off edgerton
I remember I was cold alone with no friends
I was way up out the way side snowed in
Nowhere that I belong
Nowhere to call my home
I was right there by the east side
Off edgerton
I remember I was down bad
No ends

Cuz I just wanna chill and take a ride
Shotgun in your 7-45
Oh baby you know I got your back, and I need to feel you next to me
We got a baby and you know that I
Would have another, man I want your child
Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good

Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down
Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now
But I still got love for you

[Verse 1]
If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books
I'd marry you through conical visits, and it'd be off the hook
You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King
I'd be there for you cause I know we gotta eat

If you use your tongue, baby I'll behave
You know I don't drink, cause I wanna have your baby

Fake Me,rap,Triple A,2018,20,{},"Intro:
Alright its time
To say goodbye
To the fake me
No more swearing
No more bad jokes
Because (this is majestic)

Verse 1:
I tried the fake me
Thought i'd fit in
But that decision
Was such a sin
Who cares if i'm the greatest
Or i'm not
But one thing is certain
I ain't taking the shot
Say whatever you want
I want care
I don't need haters
Just some new fresh air
I am me
You be you
Not the fake one
The one thats been due
Verse 2:
Why you tryna say you're strong and tough
Thats just gonna get your life rough
Why you tryna say your the best baller
Some people have to work hard like getting a sholar
Why you tryna say you have depression
To say that, its kinda a question
Why you tryna say you were bullied
Some people actually did and they still need a sheild

Hook:
Alright its time
To say goodbye to the fake me
No more swearing
No more bad jokes
This is for all the fake ones
Time to give those shoulders a release of those tones
I am me

The ones that been due

I think I've spent enough time now being down and out
Being devoured by psychological gout
Gotta pack up my past, keep it deep in the ground
While I move forward trying to find my sound
I'm a poet with a melody, reiterate c'est la vie
Helping others through with songs as remedies
Keeping it simple, six strings and voice
Going on, it's as if that I had any other choice
Splitting my hand, blood on my guitar
If I add the sweat and tears someday I'll be a star
I dream to have my name in lights, people cheering my name
I'll be struck by the sheer anecdote again and again
I know that one day I'll be paid just to pick up a pen
And when I'm there I know I'll stay true to my friends
I'm thankful for the support that always helped me through

Kill a cop, blazing trees, stick to bake and flee
Right away, tell me have you Today's Degree
I'm wild and I'm wigged, for old, it's like a new religion
A new code, a revolt, I write it up in prison
Ralo, it's God Body with the long shotty
The armed robbery in the lobby in front of everybody
I'm wild and I'm wreckless, murder the homicide detective
Buried his body and I ain't even get arrested
Now police is knocking at my door
Looking for me, but I ain't here no more, check it
Your outlaw and money, that's what I come for
With Lord J, all day, layin' the law, but
Witnesses is try'nna say they saw
A crazy madman waving the four-four, check it
The fire with the God, I strike you with the iron rod
Police, they'd rather come with the riot squad
The science of teaching, the rebel, I'm the ghetto chief'ton
The seeds, do the knowledge when the God's speaking

[Verse 4: Nat Turner]
Scout body in the party, and we wreck it tonight
Say it's a matter, get shot or you hog it on sight
Now why I'm killing cops, why I kill the judge?
Why if they find crack in them pockets they show me love?
I spit the banger, the mathematical flamer-flamer
Switch up and hit the changer, then get it, this biz is dangerous
Free the Cipher, it's 40 gangs, and 40 B
Sophisticated, the higher science of burglary
You can't fuck with the power or the pride
I'm a jump up, and nigga, jack your crack
It's Nat Turner, muthafucka, beast of the belly, squeezin' Pirellis
And shoot you for tellin' me this manufactured fire is deadly
Allah moves steady, I got the seeds ready
Military so necessary, the Pele Pele
El Genereli, five star murder malachi
Dippin' narcotics in bolic, like the sun did the prophet

The perfector, rep for fucking up your sector
Connect, the mic checker, ease up selector
Come again, bring it back, reload, rewind

A vanguard, you've been eating ham dog
Damn, dog, thought you was wise, now ya ass'll get slam hard
What's this, knew I couldn't trust this, yo fuck this
Bust this, try to pretend to serving from justice
Must this go down, yo, God, can we discuss this?
Emphatically no, Now Cypher, I'm bout to snuff this
Black snake, fraudelent fake, see through shell
We ain't real, you faking than a eight dollar bill
You can run and hide, but you still can't avoid it
Strip 'em of his lessons, flush some more down the toilet
Cuz you walk like an 85, talk like an 85
On the down low, be eating pork like an 85
Yeah, right, back the fuck up, you ain't my A-Alike

Take that monkey ish off, you embarrassing us x 7

A lot of tap dancing going on, industry buffoons
They told me not to bring out the skeletons in these rooms
But these children are doomed with these fake ass rappers lying about what they do
And these record execs overlook the rhyme, to put you in chains and give you a little shine, lock up your mind
Slave master mentality, on every nigga that's signed, so I decline with a freedom mind
Whipping' my balls at your racist comments
Right fist up all honest and I'mma do it like I promised with my soul polished not a flaw scratch on me
Liberated so I pass money

I just hope the world hears how these fake niggas get scared to speak up

Rapping about clown ish and I’mma be the one to lift the ground up so you really see what’s going on around us

This right here’s for all my niggas!
This right here’s for---
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I hear them in the crowd, shouting out ""let them speak""
Before the bullets fly, I'm arriving at my peace
And it's there for a second. Gone in a blink

I hope you're happy now

They all be haters spreading nothing positive
They have acne need a fucking dermatologist
Pussies when it's time to fight, I be HELLA opposite
Confident ain't no need for a gynecologist ;)

They were failing  school I was out with excellence
Killin' it, ain't no coin from my lovely daddy's pants
Intelligent, Relevant and so  hella sure of this
The last thing that was true was the GodDamn EXODUS

Ya'll have the money but lack intelligence
Arrogant flexing with your clothes and your daddy's Benz
If I take a shot at you It'll be evidence
That you're soft and a BOY that's so Fucking Elegant
They don't understand, the residents of the suburbs
I was out here taking shots they were taking cover
Hit with Lead, Still not dead yet MOTHERFUCKER
The rich gon recover while the other's gotta suffer

Rhymes so precious man they call 'em gold mines
Bars they (they're) fire like a couple K-9s
If It's mine it sounds fine and punchlines
Hit you Like MIKE TYSON at his PRIME FINE TIME


[Refrain/Pre hook - BLVCLOVDS]

Fast food joints me and my homies rollin'

Got no cash SO i'm back with the fucking Disappointment
Employed in a garbage place, My boss is Annoying

I traverse it by foot walking next to planets
Making my inner world feel small in comparison
The void cries out in insignificant sadness
Marvel in its vastness or be met by madness
Trust me I practiced, I've had thoughts the blackest
It's why I'm on this travel - red threads to untangle
Gotta take it step by step on this plane most astral
Here everything is bittersweet, tainted by solace
In that gotta find a peace, a solemn promise
The universe a Godess and we make her conscious
Gotta do our best to treat her body with fondness

Know today so much more then ever

Stick to the bottom of the barrel

Thought you were somebody else

Last Time,rap,Kill The Vultures,2015,67,{},"[Verse 1]
I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar
Stuck with ugly faces, scarred
Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands
[Chorus]
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
I won't come round here again until the flask's dry

[Verse 2]
It’s time to take the stand, raise your hand
Try to beat the case again
Why'd you shake the branch deeply rooted in forsaken land
It's not your place to operate on patience you keep locked away
Not today, yesterday, tomorrow
What you got to say?
No excuse, searching for words that never come
Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind",2900034,en,en,en
White barz,rap,Peter Sorensen,2013,23,{},"Man, I'm sick of all these people saying 'you have to be black to rap'

They have no meaning apart from 'their high use of drugs'
Or hustling like thugs when their all just a group of black mugs...
I'm sick because I'm white and my bars have a lot of meaning
That's because my barz come from the streets and now from what I'm dreaming...
Alls you hear about these days is, 'imma hit this shit so hard'
Tbh you should be talking about how drugs are bad so show them the red card...
Also in every rap I ever here they always use the word nigga at least 3 times
Even when teens are spitting barz in the lunch line its all grime...
But grime isn't good it just sounds meaningless and too rough
It doesn't make you sound good and to be honest its not tough...
Your making rap look like its gone downhill since pac died
And if he was still alive if he could hear your rap he would of commited suicide...
See when I rap I talk about my life and how I changed from a young age
And not how 'I waz gonna go get high and pissed coz its ma birthday'...

Fuck 'em all anytime I want, ain't gotta talk to them

We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly

Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces

Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican

Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved

Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot

We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot

Talking life, relationships, and now I'm rhyming my plight
Sit in dark room, late-night, scared of the flight

And is rented by a liberal proponent of capitalism
Who believes that the God's gift to Black and Brown people
Then appropriate the culture, of which they are a vulture
Caught the rollers on the lady with her baby in the stroller
Who was raised where they just moved to from in the zone
It's the old neighborhood with the whiter population
Under the codenames, ""Up and coming, revitalization""
Collective, urban, it's even more disturbin'

Hi Mrs. Lynch, this is Mrs. Zubrod. I'm calling from Deerfield Elementary about your son, Jason. Um, I've been having a few concerns just about his ability to focus in class. There are some options that I've briefly discussed. Um, we see this a lot with children and it might be some form of ADD. I'm not a doctor so I would suggest that maybe-
Uh, Mrs. Lynch, this is Mr. Bailey, Jason's fifth-grade teacher. I'm calling 'cause I'm very concerned about your son. It seems very possible that he will not pass the fifth grade. He's been failing very regularly-
Mrs. Lynch, this is Principal Reynolds, calling again for the third time. Please give us a call back as soon as you can. Jason has been suspended from school yet again for getting into a fight. Um, he's becoming a real problem for the kids. It seems he's getting into an altercation every other day. Um, we've tried to reach out, we're trying to help him. But there's only so much I can do. Mrs. Lynch, we have no choice but to suspend your son immediately-
This is Detective Pearson with the Third District Police Department. We are searching for Jason Mills; he's been implicated in a armed robbery case. We have a good bit of evidence that Jason is involved. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible. It's nothing to worry about, hope I hear from you soon-
Hi, this is Stacey from State Farm. The total for this case will be 7,550 dollars. Please give me a call back and let me know how you'd like to process the payment-
You have ten minutes remaining on this call

Who the realest?
Who the gangsta? Who the killa? Who that nigga?
Who the trillest?
Who the shooter? Who got shot? Who survived?
Who diminished? Who the witness? Who detective?
Who the medic? Who the dead? Who arrested?
You the dead, you the lesson
We survived, we ain't stressin'
I was tryna live it, I was tryna be it
I lived with my mother and stepfather, both had degrees, was heated
Went the college route
But I doubt that I'm going to college now
I was tryna be flyer than Batman so I got me the strap, man
And I started stealing and turned into Robin now
I'm just a middle-class nigga who's class was a mixture
Of them spellin' bee winners and them PG killers
Flop, flop, flop, flop, hit your ass with bananas, they gorillas
Knock, knock, knock, knock at my door, asking me to come and kick it
I was different, see, my family distanced me but I was curious
The mystery of chilling down the street, knowing I shouldn't be
Was lit to me and that's the reason why that I am literally
The only one to go to jail in my family's history

[Chorus: IDK]
A ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga
Steal the strap from my neighbor's safe, brrat-brrat nigga
They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers
At the end of the day, I'm a young black nigga
I'm a ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga
Steal the strap from my neighbor's safe, brrat-brrat nigga
They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers
At the end of the day, I'm a young black nigga

Not Having It,rap,Clover,2019,25,{},"{Verse 1}
Hear the church bell ringing
Murder every rapper better start repenting
Heard of every rap you fuckers spitting
Take your herd to the lab and start re penning
Now they singing the same
With limited brains
Tryna mimic for fame
They killing the game
They will never be tame
Taking the reigns
And im making a name
You the best rapper in the school?
Call yourself a leader I will show you how to rule
On this beat defeat ya and your punishment is cruel
Ask me for a feature im a freeze ya you a fool
Think I might not kill ya you like Freiza im Goku
Wasn't gonna feed ya but this shit is getting deeper im  competing to be-seat the rappers I lampoon
Callin me a freak
You wallow in defeat
Control alt delete, you reboot I resume
Cuz Your Autotune
Is so out of tune
So now I presume
That you’re a buffoon
Take trash like raccoons
Airheads, like balloons
My bad that was criminal
You know who you are
So this is not subliminal
Pull up in a car
Your condition is now critical
Ripping up your art
What's left of it is spiritual
{Verse 2}
To tell you the truth
Its a crime scene when I get in the booth
Look at rhyme schemes its getting coo coo
Its so obscene merci beaucoup
Know what that means? That means thank you
If you don't believe search on Google
Im like chlorine I clean the pool
The one with genes that none of you knew
But im coming in through
Coming in fru-ition
With the ammunition
And on a mission
To show im different
To all these bitches
They load the clips in
And Damn they missed it
Im on some slick shit
A bomb im spitting
I take the pin and
Take the pen
And I throw the nades
Into virgin kids that
Gone ballistic
Cuz they are so lit
{Verse 3}
In quotes you see
Everything I say
Is tongue in cheek
Rappers gonna spray at my physique
Changing up the waves
Im like mystique
All they gonna say
My lines antique
Just so they remain
Right at their peak
Ima go and frame
This as perfect
Cuz I Spitfire
You’re Mozambique
Cuz I'm an old head
Fire off a diss
And now they bolted
Snakes are gna hiss
They so revolting
They soul is open
And ima close it
No room for moping
Im cold I'm frozen
Home alone ima trump
Macaulay Culkin
Writing and they stumped
On Green Im Hulking
Wannabes i corrupt
Ive barely spoken
Scary and they jump
Cuz I've awoken
From their provoking
Shaken and choking
Give rhymes in bulking
This scheme just won't end
And now they hoping
That theres a cure
For this pathogen
Disease so pure
Have to cope and
They're unsure
Doctors they phoning
{Chorus}
I'm not having any of this shit
I will handle petty disrespect
I will dismantle everything  you say
And will show you i am here to stay

{Verse 4}
One punch now run it back six zero
Touchdown bitch go and run it back
Come against me itll be fourth down you runts go punt to the field and track
Cuz your field in tracks appears to be whack
Need a peer to smack you back on track
When your backs on track
Ima prevail and derail a bitch like its Amtrak
Cuz in all degrees im meant to be mentally
The best emcee on mp3s so i just speed to hit 90
Thats the right angle on all fours form a rectangle
Find it a cute to think you obtuse
Got a screw loose cuz you're in my shadow
This is rivalry
Take it personally
But with my verses see
That youll never be
As good as me",4515647,en,en,en

Can't accept this, it's all for lust

What up, dada? Yo

Me and my Firmbinos ridin' to the death

Wouldn't suggest you try me, verses like Gianni
What? I hurt it on purpose like Bonnie
From the bottom to the T-O-P we flow
C.O.D., cash on delivery
Foxy, everybody's watch me now
Got these rap cats mad, can't stop me now
See the slanted eyes rise, wanna knock me down
I got one question for y'all (Ha), ""Papi, how?""
We don't player-hate, we regulate in this camp
Y'all do what you can, we do what y'all can't
Amazing like Luther once the beat's looped up
Rock the bi-dells and tore your whole group up
It's ill like Na Na when it feel like drama
Boy, me and the clique roll tight like ganja
See me prima donna, breakin' the nails
Ain't come to gain no fame, we get the cake and we bail
Know you tryna get the picture, but the frame is frail
We gettin' richer, you wish you ran game this well
Rock the bells (Uh)

Some players like it and some of them don't
'Cause I make a lot of cash and they girlfriends won't

Rock the bells (Uh)

Can't front on me, playa haters we stunt on
I regulate, done on, down to I'm on
I swung on hits y'all couldn't get run on
Brown, baby, uh, I been chromed out
This ain't nothin' new, pa, been zoned out
And I flows like CK One
Somethin' in they hoes like she fakes none, aight
I'm the quintessential mistress of the instrumental
Y'all could wait to exhale, I'ma vent a little
Set it off like Jada robbin' the bank
I got this money thing covered from the dollar to the franc
The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin' backwards
Nothin' y'all said made an ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out, got reversible rhymes
We could go pop with it or run the block with it
Never before done 'til The Firm did it
If it ain't for the paper, then, nah, we not with it
Got to stay driven so we can stay drivin'
Vroom to my whole crew, gotta pull a diamond
See me lookin' hot in the crop SL
Gettin' richer, you wish you ran game this well

​Put on a beat, play my life in reverse then write a verse
​I was in hell, dyin' of thirst, the ravens were in the trees starin' at me while they perched
​
​But my success was written before my birth
​I excel from the energy I exert
​The world cracked open when I dropped the merch
​Zombies crawlin' out of the ground clawin' the earth

​Went out to Rome, spent a weekend in Greece
​Poured liquor in a glass and rolled weed in a leaf
​Momma cried out to Jesus, ""Lord keep him in peace!""
​They stay marginalizing Yeezus and they sleepin' on me

​I keep it raw with a sexy persona
​I play my role like a professional roller
​To move around, I do golds on the front and root canals on all the rest of my molars, Petie

​I told my Momma that I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best
​Momma I'mma do my best
​They comin' for my head, they comin' for my head

​I try not to blame 'em cos they weren't raised how I was raised
​They was sneak dissin' for years so I ain't phased

​I'm elated, the car note was due yesterday and I can pay it

​It's the simple things that make me happy
​the girls that call me papi, my babies that call me daddy
​the fans that listen and help me like a taxi

We don't know where we're goin
Thinkin a moment's gone past
Motions movin so slow

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, she was seventeen years old, life was good
Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
No one laughs when it happens to someone you know
Happens every single day in the World that we live in (yeah)

Yeah, he was seven years old and came from nothin (yeah)
Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke
Doesn't matter what we come from, we just don't know
Where our life's gonna go in this World that we live in

You may have heard a lot about Rap Genius lately
But I suppose you have been looking at it rather sedately
Just another boring lyric site, nah, don't be fooled
Rap Genius ain't just a site where you get lyric-schooled
It's a collaborative annotation platform where you can explain anything
From lyrics to the Bible, we annotate everything
From TV shows to sports to the latest in games
To GRANDMA'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...
Nah, we ain't ashamed!
So how do they get, so many annotations without paying people?
It's quite clever actually
And if you write fluently, concise, and factually
You'll eventually find yourself part of the editors faculty
Where you can be free of the white hat normality

[Verse 2: Ryan Vice]
Ayo, we branched out to all different divisions
It's not just rap, we got poetry, rock and news
Plus a whole bunch of other crap
And being a great editor, with all you contribute
Can eventually earn you the moderator attribute
And then you will be able to reign over others
Gain some power, recognise talent where it is due
Oh what... I forgot about IQ!
IQ can be a motivator for many
Writing good annotations can get you plenty
But IQ whoring?
That's a definite penalty
[Verse 3: Ryan Vice]
Ugh, one more and I'm signing out

But all this great stuff aside, you wanna know the real reason
I stay allied, to the RG fam, representin' worldwide
It's the staff yo! Their friendly in nature
Mahbod, Shawn, Tom, Jeremy, Illan, Tobias, they always stay ill 'n
They got the mastermind persona
To keep the site running
And the Tech guys are great, making sure we stay update
To the annotation platform, that has improved my love for writing
Austin, Gavin, Tomi, you guys always stay trill
And Verified Artists? Most genius thing ever
This is a great leap for man, one of raps hugest endeavors
Which works quite a charm
Getting primary perspectives
On a line that may create an interpretation dilemma
Being able to connect with rappers themselves
Establishing a deeper connection between fans and artists is great for the health!

This I can't believe

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion [?]
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment

We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

Castle mania
Another day, another castle
I'm in a nightmare
Of Ganondorfs that don't fight fair
Light prayers I don't trip over flight stairs
On the quest to be the Master Sword's master
I'm dealing with the hassle, of running through these Castles
Pack my items like book bags in high schools
I'm on the dash from Spirit Temple to Hyrule
From Underwater to the thrones of King Zora
I'm trying to save the day, but I'm so out of order
Forgive me, I'm just a kid yo I'm new to thangs
I'm using gadgets like Jewelry and Boomerangs
To try to sneak through these fortresses and walls
I'm trying to stand tall fulfilling my Clan's call
I'm the prophecy told by the Sages and Elders
That rises to the challenge to rescue Zelda
But right now I'm not feeling too stellar
Trapped in this Prison Cellar
Through all these castle walls
I'm going insane
Chains, bars, flames, bombs, all coming at me
But I'm feeling fine to rescue the girl
But, it's been so long still I can't find you

Please don't tempt me, my mission is simply
To rescue the Princess but I come up empty
I've crashed the same Castle, fought the same Koopas
Pass the lava pits, crushed the same Goombas
Don't get it twisted, I'm 8-Bit Old School
But if I see another little midget from Toadstool
Tell me the Princess is in another Castle
I'm gonna leave 'em to be snack food for Bowser
But I'm not given up, my boldness is risen up
And this girl that I love won't be a prisoner
Another day, so I dash Pipes to World 8
Fantasying we're holding hands through some peril gates
I reached the Castle, feeling like its the final hour
Here come Bowser, I grab a Flower for Fire Power
I knocked him in the lava, and got the Princess home
Then got stuck in Minus World, Negative Zone

Through all these castle walls
I'm going insane
Chains, bars, flames, bombs, all coming at me
But I'm feeling fine to rescue the girl

I met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mold her
(Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""
And I said
I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga

No, no I'm not your average nigga

Other honey you was kickin' it to)

I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm gone I thought that I would teach her
(Where'd you meet her at, black?)
At The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said ""Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said ""Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect""
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo
I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga

I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes
(God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
I said ""Don't worry about it
Put that shit on the side, and slide up in the crib""
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said ""Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'""
She said ""Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window""
I said ""Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy""
She said ""You never, know where he may be""
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said

I care too much about others and not on myself
Little did I know I was slowly breaking myself
This shit wasn't good at all for my health
Stuck in the chapter that seem to never end
Wish I could travel to Netherland
Not worry about anything in another land I recommend

But life isn't a fairy tale life ain't fair as you can tell
It doesn't want to see you succeed it just wants to see you fail
But fuck that shit I rebel wanna work my way up from nothing to something and never stop until I get to the top and be able to have my own story to tell

Not going to fall in line
Fall in what everyone does
Want to have a free mind
And do what I does create my own story without any worry I made my own choice I did it so that I can grow but my girl said that is some Bullshit well I think that you should just probably go
Not everything revolves around you
Gotta do shit for myself
I really did love you but I guess now I gotta focus more on me myself

I'm on a mission I'm a young man with a lot of ambition
I miss my family I truly do miss them but when I get back they really Be able to see my transition from a little boy to a young man
Understand I was too afraid to raise my hand but here I am a young Man with a plan and this is my place this is where I stand

Things change
Friends change
If you really think things can stay the same then you're probably insane

Think you know me but you don't know me at all one bit

Told my bro a secret
Called that nigga back I told my nigga can you keep it?
Goofy on my block I told that little nigga beat it
He ain't wanna listen so a nigga had to squeeze it
I've been in da hood so long, so it's so hard to leave it
I'm sorry ma' I'm tryna chase it
I just wanna let you know, I tried to find out how to make it
And ain't nobody tried to save it

I told my nigga roll da dice like he playin' celo
I'm steady hoppin' out da Benz wit' that desert eagle
I told my bro don't lose your life, can't take shit from me though

Some days are full of Joy
Some days are full of sadness
But these are the days of Our Freedom
Some days are full of Joy
Some days are full of sadness
But these are the days of Our Freedom

(Verse 1 - Reezy)
As the smoke from my blunt, bellows
The clouds form and below
I can sense the devil scheming
Give me nightmares but I heard sleep is for the weak
Take another drag on my blunt
And look at at the mountains and streams
Damn, This shit go hard
Pray to God
But this life of sin got these peoples ears perked up
I ain't scared of death
I ain't scared to leave the earth
Came from the dirt
Freedom is my only bet
In this life that we live
My life is their to give
I'm a living lesson trying to be a living legend
Even Crimson know, I'm trying to be an Icon
Megatron in my prime
Optimus to the optimum
You can feel the life
You can feel the vibrations

In the dark, I'm the ace of spades
These brown eyes done seen horrors
Made me open my Third Eye like Mandela
Fourth dimension, fifth floor
Six doors
All black looking like Genii
I'm a phantom, the flow go ghost
I'm with Vicpac
Gold chain might Toast to a new era
As I smoke my Hayze
Chip on my shoulder
Is the Classic lays
Freedom, told you these are the days
In the old capital, an intellectual
These days got me freeing my trapped soul
Jackson five vibe, flow touch you like Michael

Something about the way
Something about the ways
Can you taste the freedom
Can you Taste the freedom
Talking about you
Can you feel the freedom in the air tonight?

Start countin your blessings

I'm using my time wisely, nothing can slide by me
Fools try me then at the end be like ""why me?""

Now picture it physical evidence gone I'll be acquitted
Gettin funky with the linguistics that's tradition

Verse One

I stopped writing rhymes on paper a long time ago
Cos that cannot be copy and pasted into the liner notes
And now I hardly use my MPC
Because I find it too restrictive when I’m making these beats
But yo’ I still use a valve mic
Because my vocals record clear
And people tell me that is what it sounds like
I got a PC and a Mac
So I can choose between Cubase and Logic when I build a track
The way I work is more flexible and the library of sounds available
And accessible’s tremendous, I still release music independent
The running time of my catalogue is endless
I’m more meticulous listening to audio
To make better music for the people who support me yo’
So for the fans who reach out with the messages
The Africans, Asians, English and Americans
My people in Europe, Australia, Canadians
I hope the music I make will bring some radiance into your life
Could be the words that I’m saying
Or the beats that are playing that can keep you maintaining
Hah’, so let me end this on a dope note

Old.Person.Syndrome.O.P.S.,rap,Sinderella Mann,2020,14,{},"Intro:
Psssss hey you look listen I gotta real talk true story I gots to tell about
A very sad situation that's unfortunately how life happens in reality your gonna know oh so very very well

Verse 1:
Yo what up with all these buster lame deer
Who just can’t hang or bang
Let alone be a brother from another mother playing it cool with poise like
True R&P emcee trailblazers that’s down by law to honorable
Hip hop
Causes prepared for whatever life throws at him
Generating interest
Not being boring likе some lame-o’s cause I’m spitting rhymеs for the unlucky kids
Without a dad or mom that got cheated in life blessing them reciting this psalm prayer
Hopefully to be answered as providence eventually so sucker lame deer playing adulting games
See the error in there ways that could never afford
To help
One another or be honest let alone fathom to understand why is that imagining
What it’s like to be younger again getting shafted caught in a dead end job
Life happens being stuck in the rat races maze thats why sinderella manns
Staying truest in this krush groove funkyfresh
Never stale
Just new photosynthesized oxygen every little step
I take by myself
On this lone road not you Bobby brown to move people untraceably with power musics
Meaning that lame deer benignly neglect sinderella mann
For filthy rat emcees
Polluted corny cliched hogwash crap copycunts can duplicate but fail to bite or replicate
This multi spectrual flow let alone figure out what
Makes sinderella mann tick
Trying to mock his highnesses hotshot heroine overdose mind boggling
Keep it gangster with ya flair your trying to diss but don’t even know the half
Like any mitch bade trick without rhymes to recite yourself
Jelly sickling saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 2:
Whose living the coolest baller tipping for life thats got it made in the shade
Is what matters most fuck your opinion outside that conclusion
Without
Bullshit popularity contests dammit from east coast to west coast
Keep the crossover
Sinderella manns gonna stay frosty like a snowman using this funk while
Many act as if they enjoy being conventionally boring in some square trendy
Predictable life cycling manner sinderella mann
Won’t ever understand
Others lame deer games who shall remain nameless
Because your soo vain
You couldn’t keep the mic hot and you probably think this song is about you dont you dont you
Lacking Rockwell’s voice and rick James’s guitar skills
Cause you never had
The option or choice sinderella mann does barking preternatural powers in the dark
Rocking rhymes ripping the mic all indolent imbeciles can't relate to
With disgust in your eyes
Being another brick in the wall pussyfooter that doesn’t have shit on true loc’ed out
Hip hop gangsters like sinderella mann dropping refillable scripts to blow
Your fucking brains out with funky grammar as a certified jammer living to win
Down to expose any flaker for the fraud you are through
This melody
Thats strong enough to visualize celestial astrology
Coming to life
Thats very real unless your left behind saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many
If not

Erasing the fakes, Im billy board bound
Passing the time, I grind on my rhymes
I know I was distant, but listen Ill try
To be the greatest and keep up a smile
I know that I’ll make it just give me a while
Give me some time, I’ll be like a prism you light it I shine
Was given a stigma that I will defy

Meet me at the Bungalow bar
Never got along like Mufasa and Scar
Sorry but I'm not, wallet for a sense of humor
Pocket watch, [?] turning into humorous
A bit of Scotch with a line of white to wipe the edge
Black swayde while I swipe the keys of the ledge
I see your rocks but that makes me smile
Swallowed too much pride for my fingers to dial
Powerful appetite of the hungriest king
Hand up [?] to the invincible ring
Connecting the summit to plummet the scars [?] I put a gun to my head before I tell you that I miss you
20 feet from the curb I about to pull into
I slide away my copy of the taming of the Schru
A fake grin, but it's already edged in
Let the games begin

Since I've seen your face and
You know what I came to do
It's been a while
But we're back in the same place
If you owe me new

If walls were personified they could smell the lies perfuming from the silk sheets and the warm thighs
Look into my fathers eyes, read it like a line of text
Peaking at the mountain top, asks the clouds what's next
Spent the night in the bottom of a bottle
Should've listened Plato, should've listened to Aristotle
Wipe the frown of my face and then take it slow
Cigarettes for the show, it's time to read what I sow
Maybe stick around, we can swim down the rainbow heading east bound
Two tabs and a lock on the door
Is all we need to see what our first day got in store
You laughed because you think it's funny
I come back from the bathroom to give you money
The phone rings, time to give a dog a bone

Eighth code of law, don’t crawl where you suffer from
If I brawl my thoughts together while I toughen up
I’m might make sure that I leave, don’t cover some
Preaching from the skies, call it lies, where I summon up
Scrounging through the maze, locked prey, count on false help
But you outta days, looking lazy making maybe
Born original, don't die a copy, early times primal, aboriginal
Aiding fuels subliminal
Stop being negative, stop being repetitive
Watching all them do the same things while I write the narratives
Memories including lost lanes, felt shames
How many profound hours do you reminisce the names?
I only got some left in me, it’s “care” that I theft to free

This is the last stretch of the things I could’ve seen

I want something with u, with u and i'll always be there forever!

[Hook]

[Verse2: Pablo]
I wonder why you plead guilty, You know you stole my heart, when i ask about the ventricle you say you got my blood
Im like wow!! ,what a criminal ,no police involved i just wanna fall inlove
I know you feeling the feeling that i've been trying to feel then you suddenly call the cops cause i had the same feeling
When i look at your eyes been trying to coup all my lies
Go bohloko nyana cause i had to act little nice
But 'whoa' mommie ema i think it's time for magadi, turn a lil angel like you, ke go etse legwabe
Matter of Fact, the ring is on your finger ring the bell let them fight, we need a pastor real quick so i can kiss the bride
And your ex is jealous babe let me solve for x, you have a studio heart that's why i hear your beat
Babe it's not easy saying goodbye
But the truth true love will never ever die

Judges Criteria,rap,Arobie1992,2014,82,"{SR_thePangloss,HashSlingingSlasher,MrXercules,Afarese}","SR_thePangloss:

Just for reference, and I may re-post this as I see fit, here is my rough criteria for judging. Obviously, since this is text based, it’s much easier to disregard rhetorical flourishes, so don’t expect to get points for claims you don’t back up. Anyways:Demonstrates an intricate understanding of how (not necessarily to what extent..) their album impacted Hip Hop culture.Differentiates between cultural implications of Hip Hop as a sociopolitical platform, and Rap (i.e. rhyming words over a beat to create multi-rhythmic patterns) as an art form.Clearly states their main points of argument, and continually refers back to them in order to clarify their reasoning.Supports their main points with some sort of verifiable evidence, observable on a wide-scale. Anecdotes can be insightful, but they have no place supporting an argument for or against.Demonstrates basic critical thinking skills.Novel arguments or reasoning, which aren’t widely seen in any one of the thousands of This album vs. That album threads scattered across this forum already. Seriously, I don’t want to read arguments I’ve heard a hundred times, especially if you can’t offer up any sort of new information to support these arguments.Otherwise, this debate really has almost nothing to do with which album is actually “better”, so don’t expect to get an easy win just because you lucked out with a critically/commercially claimed album. Along those same lines, I’m expecting even more from you if you do have a favorable match up

Arobie1992:

Pretty much everything SR covered looks good. Here's some stuff I specifically wanted to address for my judging criteria:The argument being made is more important than the format of the entry, though I am somewhat partial to essays.If the entry is in essay format, I'm looking for good usage of grammar and writing. It doesn't have to be perfect, but there shouldn't be simple typos (e.g. apart vs. a part, alot instead of a lot, etc.). Follow the rules here and you'll be good.Arguments should aim for objectivity. Entirely subjective reasoning will only serve to hurt your argument.I highly recommend using outside sources, which should be referred to.Able to relate different aspects to each other (e.g. social impact to commercial success).Demonstrate an understanding of each of the aspects you discuss beyond a basic level. So for example, if you talk about lyrical quality, discuss why the lyrics are better than your opponent's album's lyrics.Length is irrelevant. The submission should be as long as you feel it needs to be to cover everything you want to discuss in adequate depth, but no longer.Again, the goal of this is not whose album is better, but who can provide the more well-reasoned, compelling argument for why their album is better/more important/whatever. As SR said, just because you have what you, or even many, may consider to be a superior album, don't expect to be able to slack. If it's famous, it's famous for a reason, and we're going to expect you to know, understand, and articulate those reasons clearly and concisely

MrXercules:

To be added

HashSlingingSlasher:

Here are some of the things I am looking for:Good, solid evidence. Don't just include your opinions, even if you can back those opinions up. You should also give some statistics, expert opinions, etc. Something that is actually hard, solid evidence, and not just subjectiveClarity of ideas. Make sure that you explain yourself thoroughly. Remember, this can be as long as you like, so don't be afraid to be wordy. Make sure that you ideas are well thought out and easy to understand. If you can't explain an idea well, or can't support it enough, then that is probably a sign that the idea isn't really good enough to be included. A thesis statement might be a good idea hereI'm a bit of a grammar nazi. You don't have to be 100% right 100% of the time, but at least make it evident that you really attempted to have correct grammar and spelling. Remember, spellcheck is your friend, and if you really aren't good with grammar, then you could always have someone else read your writing to make sure it is correctFocus on all aspects of your album. Not just the lyricism, or the flow. Get into the producing as well. Make sure you know your album like you know the back of your hand. Discuss every part of it that you think proves it's greatnessJust like in any debate, don't leave any ""chinks in your armor"", so to speak. If your album has a weak point, don't just try to ignore it, or your opponent (and myself) will notice. Don't try to sweep things under the rug. If you are leaving holes in your defense, they will be found and exploited

And most of all...Proofread! Seriously, this is one of my pet peeves. After you are ""done"", read through your essay a few times. Any grammatical errors? Any spelling errors? Any ideas that don't seem well thought out or that seem skimpy? Keep reading through it until you don't find anything that you want to changeAfarese:

Basically everything the other judges said will apply for me as well, but here are the things I will most be looking at:Good grammar. It doesn't have to look like an English scholar wrote it, but it should have few mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Mixing up ""there"" with ""they're"" or ""to"" and ""too"" should be avoidedDemonstrates a good amount of knowledge on how the album impacted hip-hopThe argument should not be subjective and state just opinions, the argument should be objective and state factsUses outside information, such as commercial performance, critical reception, or professional reviews. Not mandatory but highly recommendedDemonstrates that the album was listened to and analyzed, and argument well thought out rather than just being thrown togetherAlso, as stated before this is not about who's album is better. An argument could be a great album vs a terrible album, but if the terrible album's argument is explained better then it will win. The more well thought out argument that shows that you listened to the album and analyzed it well",359136,en,en,en

Won’t be no divorces

God gave me a test
And I’m not tryna flunk it
I’m swinging for the fences
And I’m not tryna bunt it
Got a homerun
When they said, “Go home son”
Well I went home
And bought the neighborhood for fun
They like “who dat?”

Paint a perfect picture of a man that’s not perfect

You never really went outside (no)

No shit on the line
By your mind you defined
As a queen you divine
Go to space in your mind, cuz you thinking all the time
And nowadays I’m not that sure that you be thinkin’ at all
Cuz every time you look up in the mirror see something wrong
That reflection ain’t impressive to ya, need somethin’ strong
Hey watchu thinking bout yourself, you couldn’t be more than wrong
Damn, that’s why I’m droppin’ this song
Cuz every time we talk, you so good at just nodding a long
And in a minute throw my wisdom out the back of the car
Along wit everything your momma says, you back around one
I know you thinking that I’m crazy as protective as fuck
And I ain’t need to worry bout ya, cuz you good on your own
But I can’t shake the vision of this shit go terribly wrong
I see that shit in 20/20, and you playing along
But a 30 is no game, when you take it its no gain
Yeah it feel like there no pain, for a minute but then witness
As the feeling just fades off, and the days just seem long
You seen the victims of it, yeah its harder to ween off
And two fingers ain’t no solution, you tryna clean off
A facade that ain’t really there, its yourself you can’t really bear
But you pulling your shit together, you go inpatient for real
I knew you had it up in you, I knew that thought would prevail
And I called you, thought it was jail, and you wanted to go home
And the spot depressin’ as fuck, and the feeling is so alone
I called you and then I cried, cuz you really mean so much
To the realest of all friends, who be with you till the end
These snakes, they try to use you, they plotting cuz they be serpents
They hurt you, but they be losing, cuz you the one that be worth it
Yeah, I said you the one that be worth it, you not the one to be hurting
You not the one to be hurting, no
We took the long way home
Just talk about everything
Hop up off that train, you were looking scary
Told you open up, told you that you do mean everything
Pull up on a backstreet let the tears fall
You feel you got nobody, you in that free fall
If you ain’t got no body you still got me, dog
Said you got nobody, you still got me but you
Gotta get back, bounce back like Sean don
What’s whack, be Ramadon, when you sad, the long con
Stand up on your own two, breathe in when its O2
You saying you can’t do, but I really do know you
I could write up a hunnet songs, and keep workin in pro tools
Keep telling you old news, been trying to show you
But you good at nodding along, been facadin’ for so long
Its you who gotta do different, already I see a difference yeah
I hate to see you burn, I hate when you be off again
I hate when you don’t learn, I hate when they go out without ya
But wait cuz its your turn, you’ll make it you’ll be laughing at
The snakes who hid inside the grass, your patience and your pride will last

If a book was a hitman I'd drive by for a book
Above all pointer fingers, put my life for the books

At this point, I truly hate the rich girl

And his dad bought all the toys that I ever could've bought
It's the new Scholastic Book Fair and there's chaos where it's at
So once you finish checking out you better run and watch your back
Still going to the book fair and I'm tired of trying
It's like Dababy on baby except it's fighting on fighting
Cause there's young crazies with rabies outside trying and trying
To take all of your items after you just finish buying

A little kid came up; was like age 9
Was reading records from Guinness; was like page 9
He said, ""Can I have a look?"" so I handed over the book
Until he ran off with what he took
The ripped Vans of a smuggy crook
I chased the kid to the door of his mother's car
Cause I was just about to finish the page with Tony Hawk
Ran close then I got him
He dropped it. I caught it
Worth it even though I think my ribs just got kicked in

Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine

Alright
Fuckin oath
Let's go

[Verse]
I saw this post by Karat Kev saying ""Think about your impact
What do you do for your community, do you give back?""
Anyone can kick phat slick raps
Bunch of fuckin pissants talking bout they shivs dacked, that shit's wack
I ain't ever flipped packs, I just try to kick facts
Motherfuckers break under pressure just like a Kit-Kat
Saw your little track and I just skipped that
Motherfuckers stupid and I bet they never fuckin heard a Nip track
That's real talk
It's like it isn't 'bout the art no more
It's all about your designer clothes and the cars you got
Intelligence isn't respected no more and it makes me sick
But I'm thе artist that they was asking for
But just be hard and raw, that's that normal shit
What is normal shit? I guess it's fuckin talking shit
Going on Instagram, posting a bit of corny shit
Start a beef with somеone, go back and forth for the audience, performing it
When one you lose, the'll applaud the shit
Remember when it's all said and done, no one talkin it like Jordan is
And imma never fuckin call it quits
And fuck you to anyone praying that I be falling cause I won't
I'm tryna give the youth some hope
Let you know you ain't alone, stay strong, untie the rope, it ain't a joke
We all tryna stay afloat, but the doctors don't understand us, they give us pills to cope and that's a joke
And as I'm rowing in this boat
Paddling against my depression, I'm sinking in this moat and I just mope, yeah
And I ain't got the right words to say
Everytime I think of fuckin speaking I just choke, and that's the realest shit I ever spoke
I been tryna get clean but I keep dropping the soap
So I smoke to stay high all the time to get by with my life
I don't really wanna die, so I'm high all the time to stop thinking
Cause I'm numb to the pain, I'm thinking fuck the fame
Motherfuckers try to come at me, I've dug up my grave
My split personalities are fuckin one in the same
I saw this post by Karat Kev, got me thinking bout my legacy
Will my enemies remember me? Wanna be legendary
I'm tryna be something that they will never be
I let em in, I let em see everything inside of me till I rest in peace
And I made it pop without ever making a melody
Let's go, ARGHHHH

You drove a car that was smokin' fumes wit leaks
I put you in that white range, with the red seats
You was at the crib while my ex was at the door
I got mad bitches and you knew this from before
Dope Boy Troy make the girls go crazy
That ain't gonna change just because we had a baby
I never said I would be faithful, not at all
You ain't bring up other chicks while we shopped in the mall
In your Louboutin, David Yurman charm, Birkin arm
In the biggest trophy lil row rose supermom
But it's just a pacifier you go back to bein' buggy
Cryin' I don't love you, I'm like bitch I love my money
And I give you that, but that ain't proof of nothin give it back
Could of bought Ferrari's gave another chick a kid with that

I never fuck your family or your friends brought them shame
Would've put you on now you'll get put on to his game

And the taste, of the melted marshmallows what I crave
You would smoke ya cigarettes, tell me don't talk in spades
May my ace boon coon, and a bit of a joker
Drenched me with the water hose cause by mistake I super soaked ya
One of the funnest times of my childhood

I said a lot of things that I probably shouldn't say
I've let a lot of people down, so what's the price to pay?
I can't reference what I'm thinking, not my game to play
Running faster as the light that's in me starts to fade
Why live real life? I'll just stay here watching anime
Taking three pills even though they're only one a day
Put me in a coma so I can't communicate
And pull me down to hell 'cause heaven's just too far away
The wounds upon my body bleed 'til they disintegrate
But scars are left, I can't forget that this is not okay
And how it hurts the ones who love me and my family
If they saw me in this state, I don't know what they'd say",3561410,en,en,en

Ladies and gentlemen
I have returned
Yet again
Today's topic is
Curious about crazy, mm-hmm
Are you irresistibly drawn to crazy lovers
Question: Can love be an addiction?
Can physical attraction be an addiction?
(physical attraction can definitely)
(right definitely)
Is love like a drug?
(yes)
Yes

[Verse: Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire]
I think my ex is satan in the flesh, long hair, nails and a dress
Prolly caught a n**** slippin but who cares, I digress
Why you all up in my mental with your stank-ass breath
Just another n**** you fucked, another nut, who’s next?
I was pumpin ‘til I erupted on your flat-ass chest
And use a rubber and use nothing I was searching for death
Searching for love that’s why i smothered you is not complex
We used to choke each other when we fucked to cut off our breath
Syrens sung a song to Homer just to cut off his neck
Erykah Badu had Common wearing crocheted hats
For every Yoko there’s a Heather Mills collecting a check
For every rapper there’s a groupie scheming on the event
Love is more a game of questions, not quite a game of chance
Better yet, a game of patience no answers in romance
Better yet, it’s not a game for you it’s more a tournament
You place your issues over pride, you put your present verse’ your past
Ot was lust in the first place I was scared that it would last
Couple nuts in a dirty telly room over by graham street
Came and you want your birthday that was your gift
We both supposed to be responsible adults, look at this shit
Was I just another n****? Were you just another bitch?
Was it just another memory or caution lost in bliss?
Wouldn't ask you to stay ‘cause that’d just be forcing shit
Now what I really wanna know is…
Who are you really?
[Excerpt: Zo Williams]
Who is more to blame...or who is more subject to this
The male gender, or the female gender
Not being able to pick up crazy on an attractive motherfucker
(ooh I think the males don't pick it up)
Because men have been socialized to hit it and quit it
(sometimes, unless it’s too good, then they can’t— they wanna keep hitting and—)
I will say
(they like playing with fire)
I’m guilty of that
See first off you have to understand the male science
(Okay how— explain to us— explain)
The science of man-ness is
“The best way for me to understand her is to fuck her”
(Okay, well, you know what— so even though she crazy let me hit that real quick though)
Well fuck it then, I’ma do it anyway
Well fuck it then, I’ma do it anyway

I’d stay up out the cameras 
But how the fuck can I?
Never meant to upset her
She screaming who am I?
The truth is, I don’t even know
How come whenever I say that shit out loud I fear I’ve died 
Maybe I should put this gun in my mouth now and clear my mind
But before I can greet death
I just tell myself “deep breaths, you just need rest”
Lay down and relieve stress
Then wake up and repeat steps
At night my disorder, it come through the Ouija 
See I tried warned her, but she don’t believe me, now 
I told her that “if you can afford a peace of mind, then you must be rich”

Pinked up on smash
I’m body bagging for real
Bury enemies with poison
Like I'm dropping a pill
Swerving with the vision cloudy
Like I'm poppin’ a seal
Looking for a way out
Like I'm out of the deal
Couldn't find another
With the tall, giant appeal
I'ma lion for real
Flaming up my heat
You better save your girl
Before you find her in my sheets

Need two more, need a life
Better grab one

And it really look different from y'all

And I got mouths to feed, and I got bills to pay
And you don't want to hear from me about
How much money music doesn't make
So for heaven’s sake, fall back on the hate
Most days I hate myself more than you could anyways, ay

I need me a straight down girl, get dow, girl
One to hold me down, one I can count on
I'll even teach her how to load the Glocks
Sophisticated school girl
Be on my block
Rocking bracelets, anklets the basics
Petite nice body, skin and face sick
One I could shop with
Go uptown and cop with
She not a thug girl but my down chick
She know how to roll the weed but don't smoke
She know how to cook the coke and bag dope
Screen my calls
Flip on me when I'm wrong
Talk shit through the night
Throw it on me on the morn'
She like it from the back
With my fingers in her hair
I love it in any position
Ma, I don't care
She like when I shine up them jewels that blind her
And drive by the projects while a nigga hollar

I keep her Prada down
Bitches wanna hollar now
She back out the step
When yo niggers crowd around
That's my road dog
And you know I unload for her
She hold me down anytime I call for her
Like at the time when I crashed the Jag
She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With ten grand shopping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive
Put a Glock on the dash, nigga
Watch the stash, nigga

Attention Span,rap,Anthony John,2018,101,"{""KXNG Crooked""}","[Chorus: Anthony John]
Baby I say we’re involved, yeah
Then ten minutes later, break up and I say evolved
Fuck when I wake up tomorrow, and that’s if I wake up at all
Henny, get sauced, this off plenty
Missed calls piss off many
Bitch y’all ready? Quickdraw disarm any
Shit off this already
I tell my slutty buddy she so bad
It’s kinda funny fronting from the back
I’m just tryna’ cheat on death up with a thotty
I keep on bungee jumping till’ I smash
This off Henny, wait said this already, carried away with the pen and pad
I forgot your ass was just the middle man
Sorry I just got a short attention span

[Verse 1: Anthony John]
This shit bout to get hot and heavy
Like these thots attending, so y’all not forget me
Good luck bitch only suicide could get me
Bout to slit a wrist, cause every line is deadly
Like a god already, you be flashing guns
But that pump fake, you need to juke less
Feeling bad for anyone below me
Cause I just came off the top like it’s roof sex
Who’s next? Look over and she said “Me gladly”
GPS CVS, I ain’t sending addies
I just asked ma, what it is?
And she said “You sonned it and left it a dead beat daddy”
Now honey mooning like we getting married
But I still keep a bitch on hand like Siri
I just told my main bitch to be comfortable up in her own skin
Then we both went tanning
She give me more favors when we leave the party, that’s a goodie bag
Hit KXNG for a feature, then I hit the boos so first I got Crook then got crooked man
Treat a toe like a post, not a rapper or snapper that I, the G fuckin’ couldn’t tag
Bout to pound a bitch, that I couldn’t smash, if I didn’t prey on the gram like I could in mass
I need an angel ass with waist tall tats
Can take all that, and make hoes yack, and wake up smacked
Your face all cracked like eight Ball smacks
Cause we don’t bat a fuckin’ eye, unless it’s with a fuckin’ baseball bat
We napalm that, then take off scat!
I just feel like the man like a transgender
If I ain’t, then why is this arrow centered on my damn head just like the air-bender bitch

Yeah ADHD, Navy AP, haters hate me
But the ladies they geek, they be eight deep, Mercedes grey Jeep
G500, Eastside run it, which side want it?
Anything you fall asleep and start dreaming about, thinking about, bitch I’ve done it
Short attention span though, I don’t even remember the legend that I am though
But I got a chopper called Travis Barker, you can’t beat that drum full of ammo
Like a pencil in a Piru’s hand though
Hold up, I don’t think they understand yo
Like a pencil in a Piru’s hand though
That’s how I draw first blood like Rambo
Pulling off in a Lambo, I snatch your chick, I smash every thot
Little nasty chick want her cherry popped
Want the magic stick, no Harry Pot
She can have this dick in a canary drop
And you can have the bitch, I don’t marry twat
Got the baddest bitch up in the Marriott
Look at the average bitches ya’ll barely got
COB shit, we let bangers off
Mob shit, we cut fingers off
I question marks who wanna ask the boy
Like Thor and Thanos your aim is off
Yeah look at the lame shit your famous off
WWF whole game is false
I play to win, you got fucked and robbed
Metaphorically speaking, you came and lost

In which our technology has interpreted mans situation as against nature

Hate on your decisions cuz I don't have enough confidence to make my own

I wish I could be normal like the rest
But I'm just me

Write my poetry and ignore the hared
But I can't ignore the hatred when its in my head
Saying that I'm better off dead
Telling me to grab a Glock and fill myself with led

Or no ointment

Wanna grab a gun and make it go blam

Maybe I should go back to the hospital

Make my ego as hard as a brick

Microwave knowledge to benefit, been a threat
Third eye blind mystically illiterate
Ignorant impossible to expect me to give a shit
Hearing me calling conspiracy theory in fear we follow
Mentally weary it's
Tyranny over the mind's memory
But a well designed enemy
Clinically brain scattered
Chemically imbalanced
Express malice, such untapped talents
Told what we know with an immense challenge
Look at those to control this is all out madness
Keeping us from the knowledge
Let us suffer in silence
Terminating the vermin there's veterans of the violence
Reaching for what's inside us
No one is gonna guide us
Don't see the obvious or don't bother looking behind us
Keeping in mind to how fine Nicki Minaj is
Or Louis Vuitton see the sign to the designers
Will they design a new bomb to drop on us
New microchips, satellites and narcotics
It's crazy, we puppets
Tap into Twitter and trigger our favorite topics
Big Brother babysitter create subjects
Got us all on the hook any moment they gonna gut us
As long as we look at stars there's something up above us
We lack perspective, see that deception
They flexing
They really don't expect us to make that connection
They say
[Hook]
They say psy-psy-psy-psychosis
Why they wanna hit me with a diagnosis
Why they wanna make sure my mind closes
Conspiracy my ass, they want us to die fast
Expose this psychosis, if you wouldn't mind blow this
Get deep, get mind blowing, got mine going, psycho shit
[2X]

[Verse 3]
This ain't fresh, I don't know what is
If this ain't blessed, I'm cold and faithless
If this ain't dope then I must be cracked out
If this ain't hope then we must be assed out
If I ain't right then I musta got left
If you ain't heard, you must be deaf
Kill all drama cause we don't need stress
Stop more fights than a UFC ref
I just wanna party, and kick it with the army
Looking like a star key player in a game
Insane, don't wanna harm me
Its gonna be the day I wake up in a new Bugatti for sentimental gain
My name on a Ferrari
Thank God we got a chance to do it properly
[?] Ain't no hand I'm dealt stopping me
Real shit, got this sick and fell awkwardly
No hobby
Survival of the illest
Rise over the limits
Realize what is within us
Deny what they will give us
Take what they don't want us to have
They wanna kill us so fast
They putting salt  the path insulting us
Wising up though, handling business
Stop the senseless crime on my senses
I can obtain whatever my interest
This is a new theme song for my entrance
Go hard, go harder
Go home, don't bother
If you in fear of the flame, it get hotter
Go be inferior layin' in low water
You on holy ground with no honor
Pull your halo down to yo' collar
Get paid but slave to no dollar
I maintain that I'm sane but they holler
[Hook]
They say psy-psy-psy-psychosis
Why they wanna hit me with a diagnosis
Why they wanna make sure my mind closes

Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam

Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louis, gave me free champagne

Model with her head down
Living in the zone, looking like a star with her own[?]
Looking like a queen at a thrown
Never turn off, you'll forever burn on
Heaven would fall if you ever got lost
Now haven't you thought if you ever were gone
That's everything wrong so I rather you not

But that's how it's supposed to be
She close to me
I wanna pull her out the sky, hold her close to me
And she different she wild I can see it her eyes

Meet her on top I can see that she fly
See that she shine, anyone can see that she fine
But only I see that she shine
She too independent, hold it against it [?]

Wouldn't change a thing on you
My funny valentine
This is true
It's that charm and the out of line
Hard to find
But harder to miss
It's hardly a wish
The whole thing starts with a kiss

You a little off key but I get you gorgeous
Give me your space till' we get in orbit
Let's get on it, let's be on this
The stars collide so best be cautious
The way you view, the way you move
Is elegant, evading dudes, that playing you
I'm loving it, from across the room
You still cross my view
I can't help that I'm drawn to you
I see the world pass watching a girl dance
We flyin' first class over to her pad
And I can see what you are, see you that far
Through the city lights, I still see you a star

You may say you’re walkin’ up the street
Packin’ heat at the people you meet
But I don’t care I don’t shed a tear
Nigga, you could be the best of the worst
Just, be by my side be a witness to the curse
Never be the source
In the realist of the situation
Why do the nations, war against nations?
When did it all begin?
Homie when will it end
I’ve seen the generation’s high intentions
It seems like
Total destruction
Is the only solution
To ease the tension
Bob Marley mentioned that
There ain’t no stoppin’
Ain’t nobody who can stop ‘em
You’ve gotta do ya thing don’t get caught up in the system
We gave, Babylon one inch and they took a yard
Give ‘em a yard now they’re takin’ a mile
Don’t cry
Once a man and twice a child
Everythin’ is for awhile
Don’t be takin’ it high
False prophets come preachin’ just to fool ya so they can rule
That’s why I kill with the rockets
I don’t care I ain’t got a conscience
When I demonstrate is for once ‘cause there’s no second chance
Focus ya mind
You niggas need to focus ya mind
Get focused
Y’all need to focus ya mind

Yo I peep the game closely and I never choke
From the east the coast chose me now I’ve got the toast
I was born in the west but I represent the east
Brookfields, Freetown, from where came the beast
I learned the game from the homies that’ll never put the heat down
Out of control, we could never let the streets down
These niggas don’t know what they do
It’s unusually true
They’ve got me losin’ my cool
Player haters in the game and they’re scared of competition
Fuck rap, ghetto niggas got their own ambitions
So when a wack Mamma Jamma tries to rock the mic
I lose passion
Get the punk out of my sight
Don’t wanna listen to ya message
I’m lynchin’ off ya nut bag seed with the essence
I can’t help it
Yo I hate these haters when they’re trippin’
Shit, they’ve got a bricklayer dippin’
For the cheddar
Focus ya mind
You niggas need to focus ya mind
Get focused
Y’all need to focus ya mind
You bitches need to focus ya mind [X2]

Chewin’ on bones
Ready to desert my home
With the hoochies, cause daddy wouldn’t let me roam
I’ve gotta booze
Because I’ve got nothin’ to lose
Except for my life and it worthless
The shit is gettin’ hopeless
Cause the leaders had to rogue us
Shit the bogus
No job for the lawyers, and intellectuals
After slavery, the white man deserted us
Watchin’ our currency drop and bleedin’ soldiers
Yo the rebels, they want human rights more than twice so they slice up
And if you don’t like it you’ll get diced up
That’s how it is on the block
The rude boy psyche, gotta chill with the mac
Being attacked by thieves
Jealous mutha4kaz and enemies
Act elementary I’ve got to be killin' G’s
I’ve gotta be a G cause I’m psycho
Blowin’ my mind with the endo, pull up the window
Here’s a match spark a puff you've seen, we’re protected
We’re uplifted because we’re gifted
With no witnesses, there can’t be any life sentence

Always ready to give in to temptation

Look all of the bragging you do
And how you spending hundreds on some shoes
You got some Ferragamo's where's the suit
Boy you is fraud I can see you is a fluke

Hold up I do not wanna
Hold up I do not want her
Why she tryna be my main
Trying to cop a ring and get my last name
What is she on, I don't think she is sane
She talking that nonsense, what is she saying?
I am about done with that topic
Anyone that becomes toxic
They get cut off I am not having it
If you talk too much and gossip
You get cut off that's a promise
If you are fraud I'm not sorry

Hello everybody, can I kick a flow or two?
You wanna hear some shit I wrote inside the vocal booth?
Went from a local booth, trappin' off of my Mobile Boost
From being booed in Brooklyn, now the screams uncontrollable
I am so the truth with these notable quotables
But they could've have bought anybody to come do a show for you
Not like I’m the only artist that the promoter knew
They asked me how did I get noticed when no one promoted you, ha
Man, the fans is who I owe it to, fans win the show for you
Layin' in Japan, well the plan is to be global, fool
When you universal, it's hard for these record executives not to Tommy Mottola you
It's cool when they tell me ain’t nobody cold as you
They'll even load a gun and go to war for you
I told Mercedes, when you in a Benz
It's always a Toyota Corolla that wanna come total you
So my appearance is a humblin' experience
Put the album out myself, shorty, I don’t need a clearance
Tryna to block my route, dawg, we call that interference
Ain’t nothin' like the feelin' of a crowd when they cheerin'
Shouts out to all the baby mommas and they children
All the hip-hoppers and the ballers in the building (ha)
So thanks for lettin' me live my dreams
So before I leave the stage, shorty, let me hear you scream

I used to daydream, visions of me sittin' in the coupe
So they bout to call me Twista how I'm rippin' off the roof
We're no longer in Kansas
How do you paint when there's no longer a canvas?
The fans make it for you when they puttin' they hands up
I'm feelin' so high, the camera can't even pan up
So stand up, put your hands up if I'm next up
I don't use gimmicks, I don't play dress up, so 'fess up
There's a reason they think of me as Superman
I've got these people singin' my praises like Luther Van
We go to studios just to play who's a fan
I got these other rappers shoppin' for some movin' vans
I'm havin' dreams of the days when I used to plan
Don't wanna be a star, but I could use the fans
Yeah, yeah, you need to give me that
I'm 'bout to give you hits till you wanna hit me back

Regret getting her digits

I ain't leaving it

No wonder she don't hang with them other guys
And I'm just so high, I'm not any other guy, so lets just fly

Can't we just get along?

I'm just tryna right my wrongs
I miss kissing up on you and playing with your lace thong
Fuck the pain, 'til it's all gone
And you know what your boy been on
It's been more lit than xenon
And any track I drop, these people feind on

Just tryna see your nasty side, I'm a demon

Laughter in your hands
And I know sometimes I don't understand
How you're feeling
But I'm out here, making a killing
No one as strong and beautiful to me than you
Tell me what you're feeling
This the type of love
Make you think about her every morning
And afternoon, and evening
And night
You thinking about marriage
No doubt, shit I might
Give you that ring
Give you that ring
Shit so shiny
I don't know how you found me
But I'm not so lost, Mami
I'd rather want you on me than around me
You're my everything
The one I'll come to when its time for settling
But for now I'm flying with these wings

You're a little crazy, and a little lazy

Kicking writtens off the top it’s a given I won’t flop
Half the rappers in the game just gimmicks, (gimmick)
I’m not
Yeah time flies, I been at this for only a year
And now I’m showing signs of life cause I’m the only one here
All my crew got lost and found they own other paths
Turns out it was just me who wanted to rap
Lit the flame and burned a bridge with a couple of friends
Turns out they didn’t wanna see me in the ends
Never worked so hard to prove anyone wrong before
Then I went off just feasting like a carnivore
Always played the end of the joke but it didn’t appear
Now I understand and that’s the whole reason i’m here
Mind pains was the song had 1 and a 2
Went from recording on phones to getting hundreds of views
Now I climbed my way up to the top of tho food chain
Then the golden age came yeah I’m talking the new thing
(just playing)
A person told me that they fucking with the movement I got
I appreciate it cause I work and do this a lot
I think they like my shit more than me it’s really a pain
But I got 800 plays I mean who can complain
Cause every time I drop some shit and it come from the heart
And really love what i made for once feeling smart
Then I barely get played and I can’t understand
The world slipping away from the palms of my hands
Cause i don’t wanna be a sell out, but how can I sell out
When i’m the only one liking the shit I’m about
And it’s all in my mind tryna get me some clout
When my closest friends don’t support me when I’m around
And it’s all the basic shit that’s gon get all the plays
And i lied to myself when I said I’m not fazed
And they all love the kid i am fucking amazed
I don’t even get the credit when he steal a whole page
I’m the mastermind, the ghostwriter, supporter & and chief
And yet it’s times when I’m feeling I don’t wanna be me
Cause I rather be the one in the light all the time
But the real shit I make never get any shine
I'm just tryin'
And I lie all the time, when I say that I’m fine
Cause the fame in the spot not gon wait til it’s mine
People cutting me off can’t even spit a line
And the clock is running low right now ain’t no time
[Verse 2: Anarky]
Survivors guilt I be living in a cave
Til' this bullshit came around and started new waves
Everybody wanna rap now, be a lil' whatever
Who the fuck gave them the game? Now they gon' get it forever
Cause as long as nobody care as listeners do
Like chance 3 we gon' see hella dread-head dudes
With the colors in the hair like they running this bitch

Feeling cheesy, watching mtv like mayne that could be me
Win awards and catching breezies incredibly easy
Land a reality show and do my co stars greasy
Get on twitter and tweet that im rolling a j with stevie
And joselyn thinking why he chose that over mimi
But won't tell him until we almost done with my cd
And built my bridge with zino over at hip hop weekly
Do a hook for jay and hope that it land me a deal
With rocnation and book a studio session and chill
With engineers saying whether or not im a star
Or will i make it past 18 months and go far
Im at war with myself cuz mainstream calling my name
But every song i done played for moms keep saying i changed
I can tell its for the worse she ain't smiling no more
Tryna convince her it ain't all about talent no more
But the more i explain the less she understands
The trouble of trying to keep my number one fan
My number one fan a disparaging title
Not everyone will like you the next american idol
America i invite you to judge my every flaw
My embarrassing flaws, these incredible walls
Break down and let you explore
A veteran star trying to hold it together folding up during his tour
Audience members gossiping reading these blogs
Holding signs and yelling comments im tryna to perform

Now Hieroglyphics finna beat that ass if you a clown rapper
The Upper Echelon we that class
You sound whacker than ever were we could see that mask you rock
But I’m an astronaut running this blasted rock

Channeling spirits that learned from times older

Up in the sky make the murder rate rise
Killing shit feeling a villain with filaments

And tell that bitch to get some Listerine

Yet equipped for survival in the harshest of conditions
We spark it for the listeners
Inventions yet engines we've risen, no ending in the distance

This is a duel — a showdown
Mr. Rebel vs. Mr. Gravity
What up Mr. Gravity? I just got some words for you

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. Gravity, what up, I see you took off
Now you bigger than ever but to
Me it's like you took off
Clocked out, no longer a witness to the nations
Are you playing the background or really fame chasing
You sold out, used to
Be souled out
Now you just tweeting 'bout how your concert was sold out
Dudes be making songs talking bout that they all worry bout you
I'mma keep it real, my stomach turns at your current route
Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't mean so much to me
Your music changed me, now it's just disgusting me
And I assume it's the fame and the money, power and influence
You just tryna be accepted, headed to your ruin
And me? I'm just doing what you was known for doing
Bringing the truth hard
Hoping that it gets through
Somebody had to say it, might as well be me
And P.S. please don't corrupt KB
[Bridge]
Wow, that's how you feel Mr. Rebel?
I mean.. it's all love in grace but let me just talk to you

[Verse 2]
Ay look, dear Mr. Rebel
Young brother I understand
You feel like I let you
Down, like I'm misguiding all these fans
Truth is I feel arrogant and even self consumed
Explaining my motives to all
Of these people who've assumed
It's not about the money and trust me, I hate fame
Made some interesting moves while playing this chess game
And honestly did change, but never for the change
Maturity's given me liberties that I wouldn't claim
Some of the very things I used to call abomination
Are things I couldn't handle but thank the Lord for His grace
I ask you to be gracious, people ain't always shaky
Some have different convictions and others gon' make mistakes
I'm a little bit of both and I ain't mad or offended
You can forgive much when you understand you forgiven
I done a lot of living, misjudged many people
Quicker to call 'em evil before
I knew 'em as people
I'm less self righteous, not seeker sensitive
The truth is we all deserved to die the way that Jesus did
I don't wanna make every song into a sermon
Go listen to your pastor, that's where you should be learning
I love you, I'm sorry that I'm not the man you think I am
But it was never me anyway, it's the great I Am
[Outro]
Ay man, I still believe everything I wrote on Rebel, you know what I mean?
Me bragging about where I been or what kinda mission trips I'm doing
And who I'm discipling and so on and so forth in every song doesn't make me more holy
And me not talking about it doesn't make me less holy
It's all grace baby, I hope we can have graces with me as the Lord has been gracious to us all

[Hook]
Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night
I’m looking for happiness in a place that’s not right
So I take my dollars, but that don’t make much sense
So I head for the light, Head for the light

[Verse 1]
For my pick-six of life I pay the price
Comes with a dollar sign of the fucking times
Write my rhymes so I can pay my piper
Slow nose grind, call me a fighter
Unenthusiastic on the curb of life
So you'll have to Hold me down when you dump the ice
Cause Failure happens no more than twice
But success isn't always right
I'll Take my hits and rewrite and fight
The limelight set piece shines so bright
The concept is driven by my motivation
Power on and lead my fucking generation
Afraid of the consequences of doubt
Doing my best to figure it all out
The voodoo that I do make me sharp like ginsu
So you should beware when I slice right in you
And Approach the top with my peers and we feast
Walk through the valley heat with bare feet
The naked fire simmers leaving a hot streak
Penitentiary ambitions lead to defeat
The pain and struggle that stays on repeat
The arguments happen due to conceit
Overcome the struggles and leave with relief
Keep it short man boxers or brief
Cause the Adversary of peace never leaves relief
In the hands of those who struggle to be free
So take away all of the things that we seek
And you will leave people feeling helpless and weak
Struggle to the peak
Crouch below the surface
Peer up at your peers
Fight all of the madness spawned by your fears
This is our struggle
This is our fight
Our anthem rings on into the night

Life's pretty dreary In the middle of the night

My baby girls left she’s all outta sight
That’s what I get for being so bright
I don't care no more cause she outta mind
So I take what's mine and I Head for the light
She said leave me a sign something to help change my mind
Cause I’m stumbling blind trying to hide my pride
Cause I know I’m not right to have been so egregious to ya! Jesus!
But what can I say this is the game that I play as
Commiserative phantoms sing Promissory anthems
They Start by humming
Then Start the chanting
So I start the dancing
As They lift my soul
We Throttle the night stand
We Rock n roll
I hurt
But never cry
Pain hides behind smiles
Apothecary based Visions of sadness Cloud my mind
This is the madness that we hide inside
This is the pain I strive to fight
This is the choice that I made for life
These are the people that I love for life
Show me some thing worth the fight
Give to me the happiness I'm worth tonight!

The wind on my face feels like your touch
Your lack of a presence
Is making me question
All that I have cause you were my crutch
I need your opinion
I'm feeling resentment
I crave every chance to look in your eyes
Your mystery scares me
Oh how it dares me
Pushing and pulling on my mind
Your are so perfect
It's making me nervous
I need to calm my nerves in a rush
I'm begging and pleading
Oh your misleading
All of my moves are all but crushed

Cause I know x3
I know I need You
And You Know x3

Away from all that is hard
And I'll show you
Whats deep in my heart

Prophecies,rap,Cheb Amin,2017,208,{},"I'm just tryna buy some free chilly
But they seemed to tell me prisoners are at ease
I'm caught in a bit of a Seattle freeze
But who is corrupt
Potentially, all of us
The way these punishments vary provides cries, provides wise
Provides the ability to apologize
Look at the eyes of your eyes
I'm just continuing to assume
A wise man once told me we are too focused on what's flashy
We were stuck in a valley
Exploration for humanity continuous for planetary advancement
But I just assume it's at a permanent expansion
Or at least to our understanding
I don't have a source of entrancement
Maybe this is it
Still we don't have the will
At least we will fight with you for the bill
A mix of laziness yet ultimate skill
That's what stops us from finding thrill
Maybe once we get over beverly hills
We can feel
What will be coming
So Hi/Hy Brasil
That’s right, hello
This has got me all blue even though it's called yellow
I keep focusing on what I won't see, so
I'll continue to watch you shine, but me i'll glow
I seem to prefer the intros
I am just playing ping-pong
With the idea of king-kong
I think physical pain is my motivation to be at the top, while the rest is just a test of whether my will can be still strong
I'm gone, so long
You can't talk to me, I'm too busy studying the stars
Or reading the Qur’an on mars
Or writing bad bars on what's behind their bars waiting for us inside our hearts
I used to spend my time creating by looking at your cards
In school that's cheating but in the real world it's part of it all
So don't let me fall
I know that i'm gonna call I know that you aren't gonna respond to my brawl
So just continue to stall from ignorance
But where is that place we can reach blissfulness
When we connect sites the idea of finding at Atlantis isn't too ridiculous
Continue to misinterpret what's mandatory and drown yourself in alcohol
We weren't ready to have Willy Wonka in the long haul
The year is 1389
And proof is given that predicted the moonlight
And give or take 50 years later I was listening to sunshine
That’s right
I have got a 6th sense
I can understand the light
Different frequencies, different colors on the spectrum aren’t just in my sight, but are 100% understood in my mind
What you can't put into words, I can just fine
Apparently I have the right to die 77 times and that's not a crime
So i'll continue to try and find
The signs
Hit up chapter 5 and head to the 32nd
Then tell me that I need to start repenting
They don't understand the message we are sending
But this has all happened before and it will happen again
What we need is slowly killing us, don't you forget
Did we not give them evidence?
Their insults are irrelevant, nothing except what they'll accept
From the fiddler we got more than they expected
I'm not a Mandinka warrior but tears don't come from their descendants
Supposedly like Malcolm X
You're so smart, so intelligent
For things we didn't do, we want credit
I think i'm gonna fade away like Logic
Or disappear like Tyrell Wellek
Instead of finding myself stressed like Tom Selleck
One day we will stumble upon an ancient relic
That'll prove Alavi right, and all of the sceptics
Will still find a way to forget it
I just, just hope they won't regret it
But I respect it
Yeah
I just suggest you
Listen but I expect you
To expect me to protect you

Not worth doing anything half way
Especially if today is my last day

Near and far from any cascade
Spending time in the fast lane

I don't know why so many cats play

I got a lot to offer the rap game
Made by using my hands and brain

It's a damn shame
When someone gives something legitimate a bad name

And what some are willing to do to try and grab fame

Some get a kick out of boasting about how much cash came
If you couldn't ever hit the target, did you ever have aim?

Nothing like a crab cake
You talk too much crud, how does all the crap taste?

I was mad dipped
Butterfly collars and shit
Chains from the slave ship
Dreads with the wave kit
Bifocals and wing tips
Velvet pants and a velour coat
Looked in the mirror
""Damn, I look dope""
Folded up the singles in my loot-clip
Put a sock in my pants on some Uncle Luke shit
Dressed to impress, now I'm ready to go
The club is twelve blocks away and I got no loot, so
I walk ten and take a cab for two
Black duct tape over the hole in my shoe
I've got the hottest dance steps
Running Man, Cabbage Patch plus The Robocop
Then I'll bring back The Wop
Jaws will drop and all the ladies will flock
Brothers thinking (What he got that I ain't got?)
I'll tell ya, fella
It's written in my bestseller
It started to rain
Shit, I got no umbrella
The walking turned to running
Still, I look stunning
Covered 'nuff ground before my taxi was summoned (Hey, taxi)
Got to the spot and hopped out at the front
Tripped over the curb, limping, 'cause my toes were stubbed
Then I tried to give pounds to people I didn't know (Yo, what's up, y'all?)
Like Lucy and Joe
My destination was the back do'
Not because the bouncer told me not to come back
I'm just sneaking in the club, because I got it like that
[Verse 2: Insight]
I remember when you used to be broke
Ignored when you spoke
And people would take you for a joke
You used to go to the club
And look like a scrub
But couldn't afford the admission
From outside, you're looking in
Waiting for a chance to slip by
You slide through the back door
But you wasn't supposed to be there
You'd look like an idiot if you got caught
But you didn't care
Just as long as you got your groove on
It was smooth sailing
They was playing the Thong Song
You're feeling shorty with the boots on
Cutting through the crowd sideways, it's time to move strong
To cool kick it, say something slick off the top
Flash your jewels, fix your suit
Fidgeting with your wristwatch (Mhmm)
But right when you was in the corner acting a big shot
They threw on some hiphop
People got on the dance floor
And a bouncer saw you standing at the corner near the door (Hey, you)
He started walking your way, to muscle you out
Since you refused to pay
So there was nothing for you to say
When he blew up your spot (I told you not to come back here)
And threw you out the front to the floor
Past the bar on the right through the double doors
You mumbled and swore, stumbled and tripped on the pavement (Goddamn)
People in line started laughing
When they threw you hat then
Screaming that you wasn't allowed back in
But that was back then, acting like nothing happened
You patted your Tims off, depressed from embarrassment
It could have been fresh, it would have been lavish
One day you'll make it and won't have to deal with this madness

High five, scientists!
Deal exclusively in blind spot and hindsight biases
And let me highlight this bit before I'm misunderstood
Yes, you can be this smart and look this good
Ya followin' me, camera guy?
Let's talk showbiz
Next time you see a street performer, don't give
That's called enabling
And you don't wanna get roped into
Some no talent hack's vain attempt to feign emotion
No offense
But that's the dishonest truth! Take it from me
A bloke with a chip on his shoulder and a chip on his tooth
Bully ball. Is that ref Hellen Keller? She should've called!
Greetings from the past, before America was fully walled
Greetings from the future after Buchenwald
I'm just kidding, Germany. You know I love your… guten tag
I don't rap fast, you listen slow. Half-time the video
Anti politico. Pro fat guy in a little coat
Triple jeopardy. Triple major in
Hidden Temple teams, Hitler empathy
And rectal hysterectomy
Batten down your snatches
I'm leavin' blood stains on AIDS quilt patches
It's all good in the woods until you play with matches

I’m just hangin’ on my balcony
Wrapped in a blanket with Paris Jackson
Talkin’ about how framed her dad is
Here’s a headline for ya:
“mr. master found dead inside-”
I got fans who’d jump in front of a bullet that I loaded
Who turn ultra up loud as they
Avoid eye contact with the homeless
The sticker’s the only reason they voted
And they know to spill the Kool Aid on the ground
And never keep up with the Joneses
Atta boy/girl/prefer not to answer!
Now you’re microwaving with hamsters!
You deserve a pat on the-
Y’know what? You deserve an entire Terry frisk pat search
Just keep your hands on the vehicle
I need to hide my badge first
You're not allowed to say everyone sounds the same
If you sound exactly like someone else
That being said
Everyone sounds the same!
Welp, I guess I have to blaze this trail by myself!
Rappers, I beg of you. If you’re going to commit identity theft
At least thieve from the best
Please, jock my steez! I insist, just leave me a little cred
Drop this vid into EasyBib and keep me in your cited texts
But then again, this style is kinda one size fits one, no?
It’s an art writing smart punchlines this dumb... ho
But did you see the invisible gorilla though? Rewind the video!
There’s so much more to ultra than you think you know!
A bottomless WaPo Pinocchio Rapid T Rabbithole
That chewed up Andy Warhol and spat out Andy Ngo
Teachable moment!
Next time, don’t let Fox News loose in a white-painted henhouse
And let bygones be rights wronged you never forget about

Bitches thinkin' ""who was it?"", bitch it was triple six
Devil thoughts, evil thoughts, trizzick bitches I just clizzick
Plenty of blood, no suspects, only victims laying dead
Shells laying in their body's, it's the fucking bullet lead
Now niggas in the morgue and I could give a fuck less
Keep my business quiet as kept, mothers in that black dress
Headed back to my fuckin' hood, project born, ridge grove
Hustla' raised gangsta' raised business up in dirty coast
Now sorry you're the one got me reachin' for my hip
No friends in the game in the spot victim of my clip

You better take cover ho cause this shit is on like that
Squeezin' my fuckin' trigger blastin' to take yo' life
Your niggas done got all down so you have to pay the price
Jumped in the fuckin' ride loced up like from head to toe
I pulled out a sack of ink rolled up as we start to blow
My gat is tight in my hand it's too late to break and run

Gotta ask this nigga if you can drop and all this
Gotta get permission and shit
Boss up

[Verse]
Yeah, you niggas can't high-post and you know who seein' ya
How can you be antisocial on social media?
So remedial, drilled to the core, real as before
Too many cousins in your bed, you had to chill on the floor
Imagine tellin' older niggas on the court
Don't do that to lil' homie, fam, give him his ball
If your mama gave you a dollar, you could buy a whole meal from the store
Canned soda and chips, a pan on the stove with the fish
Let it land over the grits
He think he rich 'cause he know his mans owe him a brick
Go on a trip where the Crips and Bloods can co-exist
Let's go to Saint-Tropez, it's cold as a bitch
This the Atlanta Braves throwin' a pitch
I lost three uncles in three years, let's be clear
I walk these jungles beneath fear, and we here
I thought they'd be humble, but he weird
Still don't give a fuck what you say
I'm cuttin' up your toupée
Wish my nigga O went rap before he said ""What's up?"" to Lupe
Brown-colored new bae lookin' like a cup of D'USSÉ
I handled the work, embezzled my hand in the dirt
Been missin' they kid, I was hearin' them AMBER Alerts
Understandin' what hurts is pain-driven
All them days I was stuck in the rain that came with it
Can't complain, it'll drive you insane, we made different
In this game, gotta drive through the lane like Blake Griffin
Different game, same system
I'd be lyin' if I told you that I was that same nigga
You'd be lyin' if you told me that you was a made nigga
You still tryna convince these crackers we ain't niggas?
You still tryna convince these rappers your chain bigger?
It's that feeling when Michael and Quincy just made Thriller
Martin told Coretta he wants whatever that came with her
A killer, this that 2022 J Dilla
Energy already good, I don't need no sage, nigga
I ain't your barber, still could catch your fade, nigga

Its just the way my mother raised me
Another day

Do it all just to survive

A new way to life this life

To the skies

Hoping no one can find me
Hoping I can get to the next step with just the right timing
Text message
Don't reply
Found out
She's fucking other guys
To my surprise
Our love was nothing
Guess I should've seen that coming
Lucky I don't beat that bastard down with a pistol whip
Hope he knows when he's sucking pussy that he's really tasting my dick

The time is lost
Its kinda hard

You'll never gather the guts

Special K with the shot that just won't miss
And last on the line with the magical touch
Is LA Sunshine coming through in the clutch
And he's not down with The Three but he's part of the crew
His name is Easy Lee and this is what he's gonna do

I'm rockin' in F on bass clef
Hip-hop to the rhythm 'cause I sound def
Hittin' every key from A to G
With a melody like do-re-mi
I dominate where other MC's fail
Syncopate the music scale
I can say a rhyme as ancient as old King Tut
Still make you boogie and shake your butt

And using something that's known as a rhyme complete

Rockin' to the rhythm 'cause I know you know
The place to be and the band to see
Is me when I start to MC
And when I greet the people I meet
Walkin' up and down the street
I just tell 'em (Uh) a-what it be about
'Cause it's the three MC's a-with all the clout
And when I'm on the stage the fly girl says, ""Watch""

Yo, grab a pen and write this down
And read it back to yourself and see how it sounds
It may sound like (Huh), that I'm just an MC
I'm not, I'm a prince of poetry
I don't sit down and write rhymes everyday
But people wanna sound like me anyway
So what I say, you better believe
Because what I've done, you'll wanna achieve
Call me an MC, but I'm claiming fame
Because you get a real chill when you hear my name
A chill that you get up and down your spine
Every time you hear me say ""LA Sunshine""

Humping Ray on a blind date
Mind wine with 3 divine 9 women
Who crossed d different fine lines over prime steak
Remind me of the deprived times
The thought off food made our spines ache

Some kids do it to eat, some to sleep, some for crime sake
Face a blunt when they Wake, then ask God how to defy fate
They'll try to put me under, like how they smoked our leaders

Poppin 3's fifteen feet behind the line of poverty
We just trying to make varsity
This game is apart of me
Lil bro maintain and think logically
Stack 100,000 G's, I'll still dip my fries in cheese

Who wants to skip town with me?
Nobody at the mound but me
My dog still laying around  the pound for me
I found the founders whole peace
Scholar chief surround by MOES and G's
My mind paints dark pictures from  a horror scene
Chapters from the Pentateuch and pages from Robert Greene

Free Tuition, Free Admission, Free Listens
Free my Student's Visions, Limits, Minds, Bodies and  free their Spirits
You need another the man to vouch for you?
Had the Blues when it was packed at the House
Now we pack the House of Blues

Night Crawler, Climb the roof, I'm the living proof
They changed on me like Mystique
Now they pop up out the blue

A restless minded patient, Who spent his nights pacing
My impatient mind racing
Plotting on my time and spacing
I've been forsaken, they said my life was wasted
My ex girlfriend's girlfriend said My crazy ass wouldn't make it
She a stripper now, Ima pay to strip her down
And slap that fake booty with a bunch of Franklins

Now Paster that'll be my last time at the strip club
Have to ask you, have you ever been stripped of love?

The women disappeared, my old lady sent me off
Now There is a dentist that loves me and gives me 30% off
She braces herself for me, we hit the town and then floss
On a boat with a phlebotomist, who lives off a prayer
Her concept of Heaven is backwards they call her Nevaeh

Labeled as Dimwits, Misfits, and Dipshits...
End all this mourning and get in there baby and fix grits
No lunch money, we raid picnics
Frozen dinners heat up them fish sticks
Somebody cure my babies of the sickness
Medical Assistance, call Dr. Lipchitz
These crackers got you addicted, They only feed you crumbs
And you hooked on ritz bitz

Boi, you better watch what would you digest
Newport addictions and a tight chest
Don't hate the player...fight the refs
Between April and November its Life or Death
Rap game...... is a fucking Plantation
Slavery on every damn station
But My soul glowed when I found patience
I made an alternation to the foundation
Where it if fits you, but the rents due
And you spent 200 on some gym shoes
And your chick due, granny sick too
Stop living by the sword
What the fuck you doing Yoshi Mitzou
Differentiate a lady from a bitch fool
Goal diggin, get rich within you
If your hair done and your French tip glued
Buy Chanel but Invest in some shit too

Each 1 teach 20
Each 20 increase money
Then put together funds
And then we'll all be one
Got that off my chest a little ventilation
This is just a little vindication",3351114,en,en,en

I deliver a message in a matter of seconds. And I got a little better, no question. I believe it in my heart, and now I got the confession. I'm relying on the Most High to give me protection
Enemies wanna step on him when am I gone let them? Never I'm more blessed than ever you might catch him severing ties. Several guys try to pull me away but I'm headed in another direction. Get back!

Puffing on dream
Silent but I’m willing kill

And then a nigga just might solve em
Take them panties off cuz i ain't into the gossip
Working till i can spit bars on some god shit
Looking back and i ain’t see you yet
Looking down and all i see is spex
Looking up and i ain't see the ceiling yet

Check yourself if u ain’t listening to Chaymbers yet

Well picture me cutting you niggas clean right outta the picture
Never in the box then its in ur bitch  or in a fisker
While bumping my shit over bum ass rappers
I'm in a race and just started like I’m running shit
While these niggas mad cuz they careers finished
This ain’t a game but I’ve been starting from the practice in scrimmage
And gunning for these niggas like my last shot just went in

Still get questioned bout my melanin

Does the continent have one accent?
I sound way too different
Changing skin like chameleon
To get into top position

Talk black then it's no job

Let's talk about representation
Let's talk about the weight of a nation
Put on hold when you call one soul to represent a whole, entire population
What is happening?
This ain't Atlas
World's problems on your back how do you balance
Opinions and questions that they be asking
The shine of a hero man you can't bask in
Without tasking
People under your influence that can make a change
Many promises were made but with no change once the votes were gained
I ain't into politics, I don't know how to run a country
What if we start with institutions that affect our society
What about the little black girl who is the only black girl in her own elementary?
Polluting her mind with your history,teaching her nothing of ancestry
And what about Mohamed? He's afraid to go to Mosque
He heard about Christchurch now he's questioning God
And whether its his or whether its yours are the prayers not the same?

Tell me why you hatters talkin’ on ma time

Now you got me feeling like Knawledge
No I never needed to trap, that shit is wack
The only thing i’m trapping is a bag, nothing less

Cambodia Soul,rap,Konphlicted,2017,24,{},"[Talking]
They say they want you to keep it simple, right?
Fuck simple
Every time I step in the booth
I'm tryin to push it to another level
Fuck all this talking
I can show you better than I tell you



[Verse 1 - Konphlicted]

Vivid…energy fields emitting its will
Steel handles elonged with proponents to kill
But loaded to heal
When my components erode into skill
Composing this spill
Of lyrical evoking a feel
Drowning until I feel I’m locked in a tomb
A consciousness room
Surrounded by twin baphomets
Masturbating to graphic depravic engravings
Of Satan passing from erotic asphyxiation
Whilst penetrated by admiration
Submitted by men of hatred who fill the administration
We currently facing
Turn off the station I’m losing my patience
Infuse the racist who say that the day when
The Afro or Haitian who raped and disgraced
When every bit of our culture corrupted by vultures
But most will support them and offer endorsements
Til daughter’s abortion the products distorted
And rot in exotic proportions
Nigga that Glock will not stop rigor mortis
Nigga the gospel concocted by sources
Who torture millions and murdering children
Converted the pilgrims from rapists and pillagers
To hopeful villagers down on their luck but still up for rebuilding
Just who the fuck are we kidding?
How much disgusting trucks full of human traffickers
With baskets stuffed of cash from selling ass of fucking kidnapped
Til you address the fact that bad shit inhabits the planet
Before we were dragged from Africa
The truth hurts so deep I wish I never existed
The twisted vision spinning faster than pentagrams crafted
By grand-masters to summon dragons granting the caster
Magic tools he could use with potential to rule the planet
But all the fools just refuse to imagine
Infusing my passion but rather they lather
The latter with data and chattering
On the latest scandal they gathered
To keep peeps enamored by slop which does not matter
Instead of cancelling
A trip to a church or packages of social channeling
I find it baffling
Unraveling the fabric of this tragic programming

All up in the alley, swiggin Thunderbird
Selling rocks on sidewalks, long walks to detox

I’ve been trapped in my mind
Ain’t nobody stopping me but myself
I could say i don’t care, but i care about everyone else
I can say, i’m not hurt, by what i’m hearing bout
But in reality, it makes me doubt me
I am the best, no i’m really fucking not
I know nothing bout a thot
I know nothing bout my thoughts
If i could die anyway, i’d die in a yacht
And then i’d freeze
I stay on my kanye yeez

Yeah im trapped in my mind
Yeah I wanna die
But don't wanna end my life
And if you ask me to explain
It wouldn't be the same
You can't understand the pain
That's goes on in my brain
It's driving me insane
These thoughts in my head
Make me wanna eat lead
Make me wanna be dead
Maybe smoke a cigarette
Don't recognize my silhouette
And I'm feelin heaven-sent
But they see me as a dickhead
They make me feel so misread
Wish they could just understand
Yeah I wish they could just understand
But no one gets the thoughts in my head
No one was there when I bled
Do you understand what I said
Or do you just nod your fuckin head
Thinkin when I spit that we got a connection
Only thing in common is we're both just sittin
Not makin a change in the world we both just live in
But we criticize, everybody on the rise, cause we thinkin that we right, but instead of tryna fight, we should try and shed some light, for the people who would die, tryna give others life
But why would we do something that makes so much sense
Why would we do something to help other humans
Let's end this rap with something that's true man

Fuck and go, I serve a wave, these niggas weak like seven days
Ain't been asleep in several days, on the molly catchin' plays
She on the molly goin' crazy, rollin' like a Harley-Davidson
Look at all the time wasted, nigga runnin' out of patience
[Chorus]
This what it sound like when you runnin' out of patience
Stomach rumbling, watchin' niggas make they places
Soon as you start eating niggas start hating
I just put diamonds in all of my Rollie faces
I just put smiles on all my childrens' faces
Partners facing time, spent hundreds on all they cases
All the time we wasted, tryna find patience
Fifty on the time and it came with a bracelet

[Verse 2]
Know some crip niggas goin' crazy
Know some blood niggas goin' brazy
Play foul, nigga catch a flagrant
All I smoke is loud, you can smell the fragrance
Just for mediation, pop some medication, now I'm elevated
Up and down like an elevator, run it up like an escalator
They love you now but they'll hate you later
Paper on me, I get extra credit
Shinin' on 'em, they get extra jealous
These Maison Margielas, no laces
Got some red bottoms with some laces
Heard they talkin' 'bout Derez lately
I been tryna dodge the feds lately
Bought a brand new Benz, Mercedes
Rex Road with a baby, I made Rex Road famous
Remember when they wouldn't claim it (remember that shit?)
I'm on Rex Road daily, that's the same hood that made me
Look at all the time we wasted
[Chorus]
This what it sound like when you runnin' out of patience
Stomach rumbling, watchin' niggas make they places
Soon as you start eating niggas start hating
I just put diamonds in all of my Rollie faces
I just put smiles on all my childrens' faces
Partners facing time, spent hundreds on all they cases

Dont Hate My Grind,rap,dead prez,2009,1084,"{""​dead prez"",""Bun B""}","[Intro X4]
I'm close to the edge
Don't push me

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Yo, this recession got a nigga losing calories
Can't get no food in your stomach without that salary
Gotta come up by any means, my mentality
Don't wanna dream about it, gotta bring it to reality
On my side of town, this ain't new, this is life
If you ain't lived it then you have no idea what it's like
To go to bed with excruciating pain in your abdomen
So hungry you can't sleep, you just lay awake imagining
Big dreams, big schemes, big risk takin'
Penitentiary waiting for me if I'm mistaken
Paying dues, can't lose, failure's not an option
The only way is up when your coming from the bottom
Tired of watching all these companies get bailed out
And the only thing that poor people get is another jail house
That's why ain't nothing patriotic in me
For they system my heart is empty
[Hook: stic.man]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate my grind
We gotta find a way
Though things is getting rougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Another day up in this servant concrete village
Trying to live in a world where they just rob and pillage
I'm waking up in the clothes that I west to sleep in
I pick up my pistol and I get back out on the creep
And I see the same bullshit I just saw the day befo'
Drugs and the murders and my people trying to play me yo
I ain't about that bullshit and they already know it
I don't want to have to kill but still I can't show it
So I mean mug them, screw face them, and I twist up
Hand on my strap while I'm balling my other fist up
Pass me the piff and roll me another spliff up
Cause one way or another my nigga I'm finsta lift up
Above the troubles and the stress and the mess
I'm just hoping that the good Lord is choosing me to bless
I'm tired of this world trying to fuck me like a pussy
My nigga I'm close to the edge don't push me
[Hook]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 3: M1]
Ain't no retirement from this profession
Plan B is the Smith & Wesson
It's reliable
No 401k for this runaway slave
Fuck tomorrow when we hungry today
But you don't here me though
We be surviving off of Cheerios and videos
We get a dose of the high-fructose and there we go
A recipe for the grind, AKA the struggle
AKA the muscle, AKA the hustle
It's hard enough for us to trust one another
When I see you as a threat, not my sister or my brother
I hope one day we put this all behind us
And resurrect the grind museum for memories to remind us

[Hook]

[Verse 4: stic.man]
I feel like Melle Mel on ""The Message""
I'm close to the edge don't push me
I'm trying to hold my head but its hard out here for a pimp man
The cemetery's waiting for you if you slip man
Another day of oppression
They call it possession, it's media misdirection
But you know what get's greeted by repression?
A long overdue, much needed insurrection
It's a cold world, but I'm a grown man
And a grown man needs power in his own hands
Ain't no sitting around, waitin' complainin'
Unless your in love with the plantation

Stuck in my hairs of my unshaven bum
Struggling your just trying to run

Hate feels like when its 8pm and the internet turns off
Some people are more annoying then my step mothers fake cough
My grades are bombing
Feeling hate cause my dad wants to kick me out of school
My parents favour my 3 year old baby brother I think its very cruel
A tutor thats what they think is best for me
She thinks I'm learning disabled she is always testing me
Life is crazy  life is like walking in on your parents having sex you see it,ignore it and close the door",4104244,en,en,en

They heard that BabyTron and then they tried to take my style
Wrestle who? Bitch, do I look like A.J. Styles?
The Loubs used to be the Chucks, you couldn't walk a mile
Closed casket, dummy, his mama had to walk the aisle
Still jugging grannies, I'll scam yo fucking auntie
Pour out that shit that turn the fiends into fucking zombies
Balmains on, you ain't crispy off the Abercrombie
Fuck preaching, I'ma pop yo ass, I am not Gandhi
Teacher tried to take the giffies but it didn't happen
Flashing rolls in the hall and I am not capping
Give up that music shit, yo songs is not slapping
Keep a pair of Robins, I know you see the wings flapping
Roscoe Dash with the pieces, I'ma show out
Losing bad? We up twenty, that's a blowout
Bougie nigga, if I scuff the Loubs, they get thrown out
Don't do the drugs, I'ma lose it if I zone out
I'm on fire, you can come and try to put it out
Scam Man, Punch God, bitch, I'm jugging now
Hoes used to laugh, treat 'em like they nothing now
Ain't pull up in the Battle Bus but we jumping out
Would've thought it was trash day, the way we dumped it out
They used to say I'm ass, I'm who they bumping now
Used to be nothing and the hoes know I'm something now
Stack the giffies, ain't no damn way that I'm running out
Who's that flying in the Robins? Oh, that's StanWill
Move a muscle? Bro'll blow you, better stand still
Shot seven out the .40, Glock holding [?]
If the giffies don't get her loose then the bands will
[?] off the Burberry, that's my young bull
Said I won't snatch yo bitch? I got dumb pull
I am not Costco but I keep a bundle
I'm thrusted up so it's fuck being humble
Not at church on Sunday but I'm getting to it
Forgive me, God, I'm in love, the giffies made me do it
I'ma make it to the top, I promise I'ma prove it
Would've thought [?] arm hurt, the way that he shooting
Been thrusted up so I don't know why you hurt
Stay in my bag like I'm looking for my school work
Red bottoms fourteen hundred, dawg, what yo shoes worth?
Flashing three hundred? Man, I spent that on a new shirt
Went from playing AU to swiping with the giffies
Blue strips in my jeans, I keep a couple fifties
Don't reach 'cause I'm strapped up like pair of [?]
Take it how you want but we the hottest in the city
[?] that's my dawg, I swear the bro official
You cut the fuck off if you ain't been official
You is not hard, that tough shit is artificial
You are not a battleship, you cannot dodge this missile
I'll smack the shit out you and that's on Jesus
I'ma throw a zip out the window since you fiending
Yes, I'm thrusted up, the fit just came from Neiman's
I'll pray to God that he shakes off all the demons
Said that I'm broke? Man, what Cookie was you hitting?

Get Yours,rap,Grandmaster Flash,1987,293,{},"Stop sleepin',ya'll,if you know what time it is
Because someone is talkin' yours as well as gettin' his
You can front and ignore,but one thing's for sure
I'm gettin' mine,so you better get yours

Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours

Get yours everytime the opportunity knocks
And don't chill-out too hard or you'll be out of the box
Stop running your face and try to listen instead
Or you'll be known as a loud-mouth Joe Rockhead
Success is out there for everybody,take it from me
Achieve without a license or some sort of degree
And if they claim you can't do it,this is what you say
Yo follow,lead,but get out of my way

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours
Why sit at home bummin' just a-wastin' your time
When all ya gotta do is seek an' you'll find
What you want out of life,it's there so get it
If you don't,then later you'll grow to regret it
You can ignore and think I'm talkin' out loud for my health
But don't ya do it for me,just do it for yourself
And if you need a little push,here's food for me thought
We know that you can do it,so take no shorts

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

For those sittin' back coolin',relaxed,gettin' fat
Waitin' for the right thing to come and drop in your lap
You see,you don't want to try,just let time fly
While your life goes by before your two eyes
You got to crawl before you walk,you see that opens the doors
Because you can't start buildin' from the sixth floor
If you work real hard,all your dreams will come true
If it happened to us,it can happen to you
The world is yours for the talkin' so what you waitin' for
You should be contemplating on how to go out and
Get yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours

Get yours everybody,your ambition shows
Get on top of yours game as your confidence grows
Never take a short,give-up no slack
You can't make it with a monkey ridin' on your back
Got to get up to get down,get on over the hump
Let your feelings flow and adrenalin pump (ugh)
Stay on your guard,never take three strikes
Get everything you want but get the best out of life
Ya see,what your future holds is no mystery
When you're the one who's in control of your destiny
Just put that weak pride aside,go make it or break it
You don't need it,then leave it,someone else will sure take it
An eternal flame burns in everyone of us
Turnin' the negative things in your life to a plus
Workin' real hard beats the competition
So what you waitin' for,you don't need no permission.....

Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours
Get yours,winners never quit
Get yours,go for yours,we went for ours
Get yours,winners never quit

I come alive in the nighttime, I don’t know where to go

Nobody put me in the prime time, I’ll do it on my own

[Verse 1: Ryan Oakes]

Let’s get it
I’m wide awake, I ain't slept at least a couple weeks
I’ll tell you why, bitch i hide away, murking all these beats
Up in my spine, I can feel the way, the wind is pushing me
This shit is mine, kid I can’t complain, the people love to sleep
I had to go, do this all alone, I was living broke, in the zone
When nobody showed up to all the shows, had to soe
All the seeds and grow, I had to eat my own
Take control I was manifesting everything I know
Peep the glow
Bitch I know you noticed
Been on my shit, you know I’m focused
Living equipped that third eyes open
Killing these tripping rappers know this
Villain he’s spitting crack through opus
Finish these tracks and all them golden
I’m winning these bastards know I’m chosen
P-p-picked out by the universe, I'm sorry I don’t talk a lot I gotta be an introvert
I’m tryna fill this prophecy, I don’t get why the you concerned
They always quick to take a shot but don’t know how the Uzi work
Damn
Your mouths a weapon learn to use it first
Made ten thousand off a remix they’ll prolly sue me first
Next up are the venues boy you know the shows are stupid turnt
A side effect of spitting out the fire without Lucifer
Since day one, promised myself I'd never take no hand out
I been grinding every second since
Praying that I'd stand out
I’d be lying if I said that not a single person ran out
Its just me against the world and I ain’t scared to fight a man down bitch its Oakes

[Verse 2: Ryan Oakes]

Back in it, don’t take no breaks
I got way too much at steak
There's people hating us who snake
But we just learn and make mistakes
I knew that i could go and shape
The universe to work my way
And now i think the path is paved
For me to blow that's on my grave
This didn’t happen by no mistake
I just cut the breaks, didn’t fasten
The belt and prayed, I would be okay
I just imagined, it went my way
Now every single day
I wake laughing, I peep the bank
The kid is getting paid, all my shit crank
I just had to learn to work the ropes
G.O.A.T how they spell it but they all pronounce it Oakes
If I were you boy i wouldn’t embellish all your dreams and hopes
As long as I’m alive you’ll bet this relics gonna leave you broke
I shut it down and take control
Come at me with bullshit then I hope you’re down to rodeo
Taking all those shots i hope you brought enough to go reload
Miss me with all that I just ignore it on my own tempo
Abolish memento, kid I just go
I don’t check before I take a step
Expect the unexpected I’ve perfected stepping over death
By wrecking all these tracks all the rejection checked its older breath
Impressing leaving ya’ll per flexed is simple when you been the best
I don’t even gotta flex, the music speaking for itself
I don’t even gotta stress, all my emotions on the shelf
I know that I am always blessed, I don’t ever ask for help
Its me against the world and I ain’t ever scared to fight myself its Oakes

Diamonds in my teeth, say shine instead of hi
Weed is the spaceship, calling Martian for the light
I Stan like Eminem
I want the M&Ms

Don’t forget the trillions

Stop using all the blessings as a way to get to sin

Skipping out on sleep

You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you

Døves, Døves, Døves

[Verse 1: Jpdreamthug]
There's a solace in your eyes and it draws me in
A special reason, brought to light, I had to see again
I can't be with you now
The questions that you never ask are runnin' through my head (my head)
It makes me wonder what you said, if I had asked again (again)
I guess there's reasons that I think you should go (it's just medicine)
Nothing at all (just medicine)
I don't feel at all
I'm not home

So, I'm just the medicine you take when you're sick
Well, I'ma put a thousand on my wrist
Just to cover up the scars that you left me with
Shine a little light on all the dark that you left me in
I'm in Echo Park, havin' visions with the clique, yeah
I've been drivin' cars with the figures in the sixes
If you knew my name then, would you really call me it?
I think I'm Mackned, I think I'm passionate
Like, I'm so down to rip your heart out
And you just lie in wait with your arms out
All those scars across my back, I know you think about it
I got medicine in hand, just let me pass out
I think there's a passion, I think there's a solace
I don't think I'll find it, I'll just feel nothin'
You still feel the marks on the back of your neck

Am I Different,rap,Sha Stimuli,2011,299,{Reks},"[Verse One] [Sha Stimuli]:
Thirst is nothing, image is everything
Wordy and substance verses or heavy bling
I’ll take bling for a thousand Alex
We don’t give a damn about your housing projects
Or the crack you had to deal duke
Folks don’t even wanna know the real you
Here’s an example of me revealing truth
I said ‘hold up, ma can we go dutch?'
I know I know that I be rhyming hard
But you don’t want the waiter to decline this card
Got you next time, we have a date
Value meal, supersize, matinee
We never went out again but
She asked me to eat her out I said we’re better as friends
And she still would complain about her man now and then
And even though I ain’t go out with her I still would go in, I’m sorry
Touched her like I loved her, but when she was leaving I hugged her like a brother
Or an auntie she said she want me I said I empathize with you
But really you’re a liar too
Mad at him for cheating, mad at me for beating
At least I’m not deceiving you
You knew that I was leaving
This chick’s bad, this chick’s hood
But being good in bed doesn’t mean that she’s good
For me
Am I different
Than the rapper that she got two kids with?
She said he ain’t did shit
With his life and he be getting all hype
When his songs be on 2dopeboyz and Nahright
[Hook]
He claims that he’s the best that ever did it and he spits about how he be spitting tell me am I different?
He raps about bitches and the hoes and the way he be pimping damn am I different?
He always calling niggers niggers and he talks about his riches and his digits dog am I different?
Or are they just like me I want people to just like me

[Verse 2] [Sha Stimuli]:
Than the spitter with the diamonds on
That’s saying he’s ill wants you to buy his songs
Posting his video on your Facebook wall
Handing you mixtapes when you pace the mall
He’s thinking why is this taking long
Maybe a thousand more downloads and Wayne will call
Running up to the labels all
Hype he ain’t even a southerner trying to fake a drawl
Am I just like him shawty?
People online saying Stim’s forty?
And he still doing long verses
Still reminiscing being on Virgin
Am I different than the cat you know
With a strong jail record and an average flow?
Or the one with the tight jeans and nappy fro
That thinks his niche is take fast beats and rap real slow
Or sing on a hook or two to get a look or two
Look at me, look at you, yea I’m still saying that yea I’m doing interviews
Yea they ask me why do I feel like I’m such a different dude
And I still answer fuck rap, fuck that , no I’m not bringing New York back
My target is this
My art is a gift so any time a line hits
Any man woman or child that says ‘that’s my shit, or I really feel you Sha’
That’s when I shiver, that’s why I’m doing this, no I’m not bitter
Lincoln freed slaves, but Lincoln owned niggers
You looking at a hypocrite, driven, ignorant spitter
Acknowledge I’m the shit
So what I got you thinking hard, driving in your whip
Waiting for the singing part
I be doing that too
Swear to God yo I’m just like you don’t judge me

Or are they just like me I want people to just like me

[Verse Three] [Reks]:
Are we peas from the same pod?
Are these bars and those bars equal dawg?
Am I different to the ears of the listener?
Are we peers, does it appear when we pair our lyrics up?
We rhyme similar, Stimuli, can I offer my opinion up?
These niggas cut from a cloth with the false stitches
Do I floss, toss president grills on bitches?
Fingers imitate triggers and videos and pictures
Am I lost cause this rap thing like the crack thing
But since I do that then, should I quit rapping?
Just asking, am I different?
Distant cause I don't rep a color, bring the goons out
Run up with the jewels out
Model with her boobs out
Big thighs, Tweeting how I'm beating and I'm fiending for snow nose skeet out

God slit my neck either way I be dead
Why run when it's better off dying
Cigs lined up w the secrets am hiding
I know am numb and still at the bay
Bad vibes forever they won't go away
I don't want no friends
All I want is music and my pills
Cause the two give me thrills

I’m ahead of this game like the top off my penis
These niggas can’t be seen so they took the route scenic
These rappers is common talking about that ye yo
Like GLC in the 213 backwards
Yes I got that good music
And it’s nothing to be confused with
I rant like Durant from the rucker
Plus I’ma trouble man so you get the tip sucker
Serious seizures make them believers
Till I drink that happy drink then I feel amnesia
My procedure is
Processed
Possibly due to my lack of ambition
Family missing though I know where they are
They past the stars far, In the heavenly skies
I’ve done too much wrong, I’m not a heavenly guy
It’s heavy that burden of losing them to drugs
I wanna be free I wanna clean
I wanna fly out like a Dove
I wanna be me
But I’m here cussing
Cause my flows stay rushing and not Russian like those commi’s
Though The state of mind of the world is a little Mitt Romney
So here’s a few words from my distant friend
Be unstoppable always till the very end

True master is me
I mastered the master
Now the master is me
What’s the matter with me
What’s the matter with you
It don’t matter fuck the matter
What’s happening dude
It’s Common to Common
Who has nothing but cent
These beats get hit
Now your flows get sent
My flows make sense
Your flows lack passion
I’m passing while flashing
The art form of fashion
Drugs get me drugged
So my skills lack cohesion
Carefully crafted automatic
Indonesian
Contact the combat
Comeback with the force
I was forced into the life
Now white is what’s right
Listen to me
I wanna rap but lord knows I try more
I gave all I had so it’s nothing left to die for
That’s why we’re here
Hear me
I’m curious of what I’ll be
When I leave
Hopefully I’ll be stable
And off the cain so this time I’ll be able
My tales not fairy
My tales not fable
But I’ll give sweet sixteens
Till my nicknames maple

[Verse 1]
They say u can't paint the perfect picture
Can be worth a thousand words but can't decode the scripture

What they don't understand call that the mixture
Of mystery
Of unanswered thoughts turned into misery

The victory
Discovering blue diamonds digging in Sicily
The picture be so blue ray clearer and vividly

Standing under Zeus feet got me spiritedly
Spiritual
To overcome the impossible
The miracle
The biblical
Keep that beside me my left arm
Psalms 27:1, 1 john 5:4

Faith stay high an sharp like that floating sword

The sword of Damocles
Hanging right over me

I wish
To over come the misunderstanding
Stand alone in a stand off be outstanding

The gladiator
That runs though my blood an flows

Till I die an I see  grass Luke Russel crow

True statements
Coming from Jr the god

All my life all I was was the underdog

People doubted me starred pointing out all my flaws

But could give 2 cents bout the site an blogs
I just got to keep moving pursuing
The thing that I'm doing
An have a Knick like Ewing

Too many duck duck nXggas up in the game
Till the Fuck up an start point fingers like they be lames
Then they must cut back an tell lil homie get u
Then u pointed out like playing that duck duck goose

Yea I been around this game
It's so crazy that it will drive you insane

I'm trying to explore the unexplored
I'm king like a lion with  a  strong roar

They try to clone my bars call that the clovery

Unheard of project the rovery

Rapbeth Foul is Fair,rap,MC Lars,1999,170,{},"Sometime Shakespeare's overdone
His constant sadness is no fun
The comic relief's the best part
Fans just can't wait for it to start
The pain inside Macbeth is clear
It seems to bring a heavy tear
The story's tragic most the time
Who needs free reverse when you've got rhymes?
What's hip from Macbeth you say?
Comic relief, on any day
And so we'll take the funny parts
And understand just where they start
We'll take the rhymes that stick out most
And loop them twice so not to boast
We've got this sound for MTV
We introduce the witches

Thrice the A-flat coord has rung
Thrice and once the symbol chimed
Producer cries ""tis time, tis time""
Producer cries ""tis time, tis time""
Round about the record goes
Into which our lyrics flow
This language is likely not
To not go into our pot
[Chorus]
Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Fair is foul and foul is fair
We must warn you, Macbeth, beware

I never wanted to be a witch
Casting spells gives me an itch
I'm allergic to my cat
And this black robe makes me look fat
Bringing apparitions is
Not really the type of biz
I want to be in for good
I would quit if I could
But saying that I'm out of here
Is not something that people
So we're stuck here for a few more years
Never mind Hecate's jeers

You want an apparition? I'll give you an apparition
You listen to your wife too much and you'll end up beheaded

Don't tell me what you want
What you really really want
Macbeth
If you want to get ahead
By staying away from murder
And be happy with your power
If you want to get past Act 5
Keeping your head
You know that power's bad
When it makes one of your loved one's sad
Sad, so sad
Guess that Malcom wouldn't be too glad
When you see what you did to his too dad
Fit with Duncan [?]
It were done quickly
So now I ponder about killing this guy and inheriting even more power
So if I do do all these evil deeds
I will probably suffer horribly as we all know the power of karma
And power corrupts, obviously, so I am determined I guess to stay away from slaying Duncan
And stick to living a peaceful life
But wait, is this a dagger which I see before me?
The handle toward my hand
Come! Let me clutch thee
And in doing so I will kill Duncan
My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
We are yet but young indeed
We are yet but young indeed

The moral of the story is
Lighten up and try to give
A new perspective to your life
It's not all dark pain and strife
Don't get caught up in old tradition
Or swallowed by superstition
And thespians would be completer
Shouting ""Macbeth"" in the theatre",538531,en,en,en

Let the People Say,rap,Tantrum T.A.,2020,23,{},"[Intro: T.A.] I speak for those who have never been heard
For those who have been overlooked
I am the voice of my generation
I am The People

Listen, let us pray for a better day and
For forgiveness 'cause the flesh that we all wear is tainted
I know my spirit gonna fly if my breath is taken
So I don't fear death 'cause heaven is my destination

[Verse 1: T.A.] The President shakin' hands with the terrorists
Keep ya eyes open don't sleep, David Letterman
Keep the 9 on me, don't believe they protection is
Geared up to cover us dark face Americans
I pray everyday for all my relatives
And the youth, bein' shooed from the truth
Any fool can see the proof
That our hues be the noose
Ask Zimmerman, they use us as screws to hang they head of deer
Never scared to put my Trayvon hoodie on
No more soda, Arizona from the goodie store
Bag of Skittles just so they can get the riddle
I don't fear no man or no government official, naw
Only God can judge me you can put ya gavel down
I know his blessings cover me when I'm on battle grounds
I ask the Lord to plant my feet on shattered grounds
And walk though the shadowed towns
Head up hammers down
[Chorus] They try to strip us of our self worth but still pride's here
We been set up for failure since we first got here
Let the people say, let the people say
Let the people say, let the people say

It's no segregation still racism's right here
Let the people say, let the people say
Let the people say, let the people say (amen)

[Verse 2: T.A.] Land of the free, home of the slaves
Seems like we livin' in vain by jugglin' minimum wage
But we rich in the brain, to me that's bigger than pay
And the government know it that's why our statistics is paved (Yeeeah)
So now I'm forced to live as a Bandit
A young black savage born victim of slavery's damage, I
Shed tears for the baby daddies
And the single mothers raisin' kids anyway she manage
Faith's advantage
I watched my mama struggle everyday and face disaster
My father figure was Ben Frank and my favorite rapper
No marriage, single parent now I'm labeled bastard
Police slay and harass us so my holster favor Magnums yeeeah
Safety off like Polamalu injured
'Cause evil's round me tryna falsify all my credentials
No weapon formed against me shall prosper as I remember
My bible scriptures encrypted inside my mind monumental

We been set up for failure since we first got here

Yeah, momma on my mind

Gotta get this cheese to get up out this trap
Taking penitentiary chances, playing Russian Roulette
Ducking out police, trying to cheat the angel of death

[Verse 1: Mikkey Halsted]
I learned the cheat code from real niggas
Got out the house early, I was a field nigga
Let's be honest, these artists don't paint the real picture
I try to listen but honestly, I don't feel niggas
I was Polo, Nautica, Hilfiger
Been fresh to death, therefore we spill liquor
You dummies don't even get it, do you
Rapping my life, you suckas don't even live it, do you
From where pussies get fucking wetter
Still my daddy made me fight them niggas head up'
I dig the knowledge, I hope these cowawrds is read up
Funerals get expensive, I hope that you got your bread up
Go ahead and jump out that window
I stopped playing with niggas after Nintendo
I know you niggas is pillow
You want to understand Mikkey, it's this simple

Bury so many family I'm feeling numb
So many homies, it hurts even worse when they young
Sometimes I ain't proud of where I'm from
I wonder if momma's proud of what I've become
She say she is but I know that she wanted more from me
Know that God got something special in store for me
See, the journey just made me more hungry
I'm not bitch, need no man to open the door for me
I wish daddy could see me, my granny could feed me
Her famous lemon cake, wish scarface never plugged G.D
And my cousin Cee-lo Reed was here to hear my CD
I gotta step up in his daughter's life, I know she needs me
Chasing Lamborghinis, I'm merciless
Overdo it, every line is superfluous
Chicago the place that birthed this shit
But we claim the whole universe as our turf

Yech, I can't escape the slander
The irony of ""I escaped the slammer""
Guess I'm Houdini in that motherfucking manor
Local authorities can't oppress my grandeur
They see me three ways, MTV with the VJs
Any mag cover or TSA in my PJ
Whoo, I fly 'em every so often
When I die, Maserati rig the coffin
Thirteen millionaires on the run to Boston
Call spades by the racist ass Massachusetts officers
Digest, put it together niggas
Ha, I was simply being clever, niggas
Lucky for you, this ain't my sole endeavor, nigga

Check one check two since you know what to do
Gotta salute Skyzoo before I give it you
All I ever wanted was a Bad Boy logo
And then came the Roc, that’s when everything stopped
Fascinated by the R, the bottle half-popped
For the record, those pre-Doubt records was kinda hot
Dreams on the yacht where the video was shot
Tuned in 10 o'clock, Funk Flex on the box
Lenny San-tia with the Benz in the lot
Get the picture? Ha This a Kodak opp
And we was on the block, probably out duckin' cops
Goin' half on wings and fried rice out the wok
In the crib watching BCAT, really tryna be that
Holmes said its deep and the coke hit his kneecaps
I don’t know, I believed that
Pictures so vivid I could see that
From then it was on, writing all night long
To get the chain and the charm, Jesus hangin' by the arms
This ghetto gospel, save us with these psalms
The Hymns that we spin, these are more than just songs
Close ya eyes and imagine, a certain type of passion
Room full of execs, Dame Dash spazzin'
Feeling like everything we want, we could have it
This our shit, you just a quarter water bastard
In an Iceberg sweater
Screaming we don’t don’t want deals no more, it’s joint ventures
50/50 splits, the publishing lit
Full of smoke in the whip, Christión with ya chick
Back and forth trips to PA with the clique
Right around the same time they gettin' at Kiss
We studied and watched, we listened to the LOX
And the L freestyle, we taped off Stretch and Bob
The same one they said that the God got washed
I dunno, I never really saw it as a loss
Gotta ask yourself what do you want more
The hard knock life, or the hard knock life tour?
Crack in the hall or the plaques on the wall
As far as movements that was the illest that I saw

But these re-runs are played out, a shame if you're fooled
How many times you gon' fall for the same old script?
Buy in to the war propaganda they print
It defies common sense, any logic at all
To think the Syrian state would at all be involved
In chemical attacks at the moment inspectors
Had entered the country, like they just that reckless
The red line was crossed? that was months ago
When the rebels used sarin gas, but that was okay though
I guess the beheadings and the burning of churches
Falls under ""democracy"", you fuckers are worthless
I'm ashamed of this country, there's nothing in common
With me and my government, the only bombing
That I will condone is against D.C
And you can bury this whole fuckin' system six feet deep

[Verse 2]
We need to have some basic lessons about revolution
'cause all I see right now is just sheer confusion
It isn't a synonym for any uprising
The leadership's decisive if we analyzing
The FSA is deeply, profoundly backwards
There's nothing progressive 'bout their vision or tactics
They tools of the west, tools of the sell-out
Real revolutionaries say ""get the hell out!""
Syrian Civl War? That ain't correct
It's a proxy conflict in every respect
Syria's a beacon of independence
These devils in the west, they aspire to end it
And relegate it back to colonial days

Doing investing and
Starting a family

Letting your mama down

This is it I believe
Fuck this shit I don't care
I will let no one tear
Nothing away from me

[Malice] E-40 and the Clipse, yeah
[E-40] {*cut and scratch ""The Quarterback""*}

[Verse 1 - Malice]
Tell the cops don't read into it, them days of slangin
Yay been finished, them days have been done ended
So far gone them days that I'm offended
Snitches can't speak my name till they get winded
Can't you tell there's been a switch made?
Now fellas decide, that they wanna run and tell like in the 5th grade
But I'm too gone, young'n be clear
Even when you see me, I am not really there
And I ain't play fair, wit my eye on the enemy
Huggin the block just me and my mini-me
Did it and lived it, grinded here
Cops feelin where my crotch at, find it yeah
Not only was I in the game I was gifted in it
Served food to the fiends and we called them dinners
Put the raw wit the fakeout, mixed it in it
Can't explain it, cats hustle guess it just was in us, Malicious
[Hook - E-40]
If you got the turn cracking and ya money's stackin'
Ya, quarterbackin', quarterbackin'
Leader of the squad and you're the team captain
Ya, quarterbackin', quarterbackin'
Got a little change and you're driving a Range
Ya, quarterbackin', quarterbackin'
If you're sound system bangs and you're pushin them thangs
Ya, quarterbackin', quarterbackin'

[Verse 2 - E-40]
Might not know what I'm talking about, if you ain't never lived it
I see you'd a done it, see fiends vomit
Green stuff I had to clean it up wit Comet
Mean stuff, so many deaths my streets is haunted
Believe us, you shoulda seen us
Like Wild E. Coyote make super genius
Gets a lots like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life
But not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my scale for a microphone
And be rapping about it up in this song, sliding on some chrome
Uh, this long money I earn, I'm bald-headed
But I used to have a Lord Jesus perm (Lord Jesus perm)
When my name was Earl, before the rap game
Running from Secret Squirrel, I had my own thang
I was raised by wolves, hyenas and barracudas, gorillas and bulls, uh
[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
I play the field like Vick, from endzone to endzone
Serve that ish like snow cones in the hood
And trench in the gutter, I was lost to the good
Cause I make gat stutta, like an O.G. should
Mama's lookin', so mistooken
Night's in the kitchen, thought I never finish cookin'
Way before, paid for this here that I'm mouthin'
Nineteen years young, upward of eighty-thousand
Trust me young'n, Pusha was never browsin' for nothing
Section 8, housing; I'm stomping through like King Kong
Claiming his home his jungle
Mumblers beware the hood hate singers
I connect block to corner like Jenga
Fall never, you seen em
Posting in ya hood, leaning fiends like the Tower of Piza
Damn he's good

[Hook x2]

[Outro - E-40]
Uh! Now of course ya know I ain't talking about sports
(The Quarterback) I'm talking bout runnin' some shit
I'm taking about orchestrating and illustrating
And glorifying yo paper route
Getting out there hustling, grittin and grindin
Doing yo thug thizzle, magigledale
Quarterbackin man, hustlin' mayne
Trust that manye, yeah in real life mayne
Some call it pitchin', some call it grindin'
We call it quarterbackin'

I said to myself, ""This tape sound funky""

Took another look and that butt was booming
Did a little trick on my freestyle fix

She said, ""Hi, DJ KRS""
She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
She said, ""I'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
If you give me a lift, while we ride we'll debate""
She jumped on my bike, I said, ""Huh, what's your stop?""
She said, ""Right around the corner to the crack spot
If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
But if you don't, you might as well step back""

For a play, not your everyday trey
We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock

I said, ""You better get yourself a job""
She tried to tell me that times were hard
I told the ho, I said, ""Yo, that's not my fault

Utopia,rap,Murda Mar,2020,6,{},"Yea

I feel like Ive been working on this song forever and still haven't finished it so I just deleted everything I recorded and started over

Someone please tell me what the fucks next. I think Im happy but most of the time Im upset

Im from a dark place, fuck a sunset. Young black man with a dream im the suspect

I dont feel like workin but I need that last check. This world won't miss me until I take my last breathe

But Im here tryna fly of in a fast jet. Swerving through traffic wondering how I ain’t crash yet

Not one to judge, not to judge all these fuckin people
Some poor, some silver spoon how the fuck we all equal

An epidemic, some friends playin wit that damn needle
A movie I seen too many times I should own regal

Betrayal, like damn it really be yo own people
I wanted to hold her hand but she don’t even like the beetles
Fear of my own imagination this a damn sequel
Pay attention when you don’t help how they all treat you

How ironic now I’m the bad guy
Why I’m distant from everybody you shouldn’t ask why

I don’t even get mad when I see her ass cry
I’m a different breed of nigga nothin like your last guy

Listening to 90s music yea my favorite past time
But y’all never see the real me yall have bad eyes

My life filled with many complications, you say
You’ll help me but you Afraid of my confrontation

But I ain’t mad, I ain't mad, I ain't mad cause no one understands
It only matters when I give a helping hand

I just wish I had someone I could call for
God can’t help you’ll never catch me on all 4s

Why hail somethin I dont know is true
And anytime you question it God he will punish you

To me, that’s worse than I’ll ever be, ever be, ever be
I take my anger out on people that are close to me
But never put their lives up in jeopardy, and the way that I feel
I should already be a celebrity

I’m always tryna make a better me
I don’t need your advice don’t try and lecture me

Put yo faith in people and that’s when the shit fall
Couldn’t trust that girl always goin through them withdrawals

In front of me I keep up a thick wall
To make sure I don’t walk around like a sick dog

But at the same time I know that I’m a sick dog
Cause I don’t want love I’m just tryna get in a bitch drawals

I don’t even care if this a hit dog
Just know if I die i dont know if I’ll miss y’all

Wait, how can I  really think after death
It’s probably the same feeling that a nigga have after sex

Which is no feeling at all, wondering how the fuck I even got involved
With a person I don’t even like to call

I make sure I stay in and im walk-in tall
You’ll create big problems when you’re thinking small, thinking small, thinking small
I dont want nothin to do with these people at all

I ash my blunt where i want to, either way im getting paid

I hit my homie phone, he hit me back like ""what up yellow jones?""
Told him i just copped an O, i'm tryna see if he wanna go smoke
Aye, they say i fumbled the bag, bitch im Dez Bryant that's really a catch
And im really a catch, ain't no catfish 'cuz i'm really this bad
Can't rise and shine unless i'm waking and baking
Thats the most important meal of the day
Blowing through pounds like we losing some weight
New workout plan we do this everyday
Don't talk to me when i'm faded
If you do then ill probably forget it
But really don't take it offensive
Its just 'cuz my mind's on vacation

I just feel so sunny, when i wake up in the morning
Gotta go get me some money, im tryna open a bank
I need marijuana, that smoke around me like my aura
I ash my blunt where i want to, either way im getting paid

Hard On Yourself,rap,Mr. Probz,2013,4197,{},"You try to do your best but never seem to get far
No gas in the car, looking for a buck in a jar
Your Ex girl's on the phone saying life is hard
And that bitch left you with no money on your cards
You're lying to yourself with no pause
How it's all part of your plan and written in the stars
In the real world you're sugarcoating your flaws
You've just lost your job and you shitted on your boss
And the rent is due but nobody wants to hear what you've been through
You're blaming everyone and how they did you
Everybody is looking at you in their rear view
It's like you're doing everything that you should not do
Why are you looking in the mirror when it's not you
Standing on the corner until the block cools
With something tucked in your belt
Why you make hard on yourself
Don't make it hard on yourself bro

Years gone by
Got something on your mind
No matter how hard you try, you try
Why you make it hard on yourself (x4)
It's like your glass is always half empty
But keep picturing yourself driving in that Bentley
Now picture yourself on the opposite of rich
And that's exactly what you get it if you don't step it up, quick
You never think about tomorrow
Your stress is getting worse with every penny you've borrowed
You might as well start packing up while you're staring at your mailbox
Bills stacking by the truckload
Trying to fool the whole world but your momma knows
She already knows how that song goes
Your pops was a rolling stone
The apple never fell far from home
And no body's picking up their phone
They don't wanna hear the same old shit in the same sorry ass tone
In the meantime tell them that you don't need no help
Listen, why you make it hard on yourself
Don't make it hard on yourself bro

Years gone by
Got something on your mind
No matter how hard you try, you try
Why you make it hard on yourself (x4)",218792,en,en,en

For my war dogs i'ma go out on a limb
She wanna shoot a movie it's gone be a feature film
My character is birdie, i'm so above the rim
Money is the motive, the mission to get the M's
N****'s wanna be involved wasn't with us in the gym
Real boss player was mac'n before the internet

Lurking on the label page, see we do it big
Kicking yourself daily, wish you never burnt the bridge

Kill off ya whole colony terrorize when we swarmin'
Step up and kill the stage, whenever i be performin'

Tried to forget but all girls are the same

I have no clue how to deal with the heartbreak
You do not know how I am that is okay
Tired of sadness and feeling so lonely

So many tears on my bed, right now
Since i left my girlfriend my life's in a whirlwind
I think I'd be better off dead right now
What's become of me?
I've become ugly
Word on the street, is they heard I'm a beast
And that's prolly why these ho's run from me
What the fuck, do you want from me?
Love and affections, bitch I've got nothing
Call me an asshole, call me an arrogant fuck
I don't even let God judge me
I'm stuck in my ways
Give a fuck whatchu say, you cannot budge me
Stay the fuck away
Cause your love's at stake if you broads love me
I am not joking, let it all soak in
The hole in my heart would eat you alive

We can fuck all you want, if you're looking for love
I will leave you deprived
If all that I need is me
Then why would there ever be ""you and I?""
Nowadays all they do is cry and tell me I ""I need you to try""
And I really need you to leave, I'll give you reasons to go
I got these demons in me and these fuckers eat out my soul
Yes, they are defeating me
It's best you leave me alone
Because being with me, means they must be in control
Feel like I'm losing my soul right now
I don't even fucking know right now
Drinking to slumber
Weekends I recover
Shit there is no other me to go right now
I should have run
Never been good at love cause it's not for real
I really need to get my mind off things
Shoulda took that drug
Shoulda popped those pills
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure my heart don't feel
Like lighting up, and driving drunk
I wonder how I got home still
No matter what I do there's a part of me that's not fulfilled
So, if all I do is break shit then why would you want to build?
It's a big mistake, so just sit and wait for the next man to come and love you right
Cause I'm the fucked up type, that'll fuck up once and fuck up twice
With no second thoughts, girl
You're better off, and no. You'll never become my wife
Nothing you can do or say to make you become the love of my life
What's wrong with me? Is there a name for this? Can anyone relate to this?
My shamelessness will leave you in pain
But I hate being this way, nothing's making sense
I fucking hate regrets
So many failed attempts
Either this drink's gonna take my life or I will

Hey, yo, it's - it's kind of like this...

I keep it hot like jerked chicken, you jerk your chicken;
If I go platinum, then that's one million burned victims
I learned the system, stepped up, and earned a position;
Now I'm startin' the game, benchwarmers, I'm not concerned wit'em
They fake with booty raps;
I heard somebody say they label
Gets them niggas onstage with Scooby snacks
Where's Shaggy, though? Jugga wrecks songs, you do cameos
MC's run, plus they see-through like pantyhose
I couldn't hide the fact that I'm fat with baggy clothes;
Fatter than fat...Jenny Craig mastered my DATs
I'm the big bastard with gats who fractured your back;
Faster than track: photo finish, capture and snap
You slack, I got stocks, bonds and 401K;
You'll never be raw, unless you do a porno one day
OK, I can't really be touched now, you get it?
Fans got they hands up like they signalling touchdown
Like end zone, but what now?
The willy bruises mics so bad
You'd think my cordless had light skin tones
Or perhaps anemic JuggaKno(???), the bad genius
Spits rhymes so hard you'd think my lines had penises
I stand erect, MC's wake up thinkin'
'What bad dream this is, I demand respect!'
Even comin' off the head like Marie Antoinette
Flows run ridiculous
Enough to make nuns promiscuous

You couldn'tve thunk;
Puttin' on the hits, you just get put in the trunk
I'm off the chain crunk, you scared to show game;
I push so many wigs back they gave me shares of Rogaine
I'm sayin', we can fire rounds or fire prose;
You tell me, I don't give a fuck like retired hoes
Not the Feds, but I tap jaws like wired phones
Or draft beer...
Get up in your girl like Pap smears
Enough. None of you
Knew me last year, now you want Big Daddy gear
And Jugga Underoos too
It's funny how niggas switch
Since I'm gonna get money now
Dis the Altima for bigger whips
Sisters with thicker hips, bigger tits...
Tequila shots, frequent trips to the reefer spot
And you swear my tracks eat alot, they so fat
Show me the hardest cats
They get popped with they own gat
Don't act up when your spot get blown;
Drop the phone, and look at it - watch your tone
Cock the chrome, (????)

Your parents even say, 'How the fuck is he unsigned?'
I dunno, I guess y'all got me on that;
My only answer is these A&R's is probably on crack
Actin' like sales sum up skills
But I'm still harder than it is for men
With no knees to run up hills
And I don't have a deal, just mass appeal
And raps that kill...Jugg's up in more cuts than Massengill...

Numb To love Part 2,rap,Fewmet,2021,17,{TG},"[Intro: TG]
Da da da, da da da da da *muffled*
Mmm I think that *muffled*
I am numb to love
I think that, I am numb to love
I think that, I am numb to love ohhhh

[Chorus: fewmet]
I don't even know if its fair anymore
You don't even know if you care anymore
Life's fucked up and you know it
I gave you my heart then you broke it
Aye, fuck love 1 time
Fuck love 2 times
Fuck love another time
I'll just snort another line

[Verse 1: fewmet]
Aye, To get past the times that you made me go through
My friends asked all the time like damn who broke you
Is love just, A joke to you

I think that I am numb to love

Fuck love another time
I'll just snort another line

[Verse 2: TG]
And I wrote this song with you in mind, yuh
I watch our love shatter like glass
And within seconds you would thought of my past
How I left you alone
I guess that's my bad
Just give me a day or 2 cause' I know that I'll run back
And every time you said you loved me was a lie
I've been living in pain cause' I don't have you by my side
No one could love each other more that shit was always a tie
Now I know I want it, cause' you left me to die
And I still wonder what we could have became
I tried so hard and it is such a shame
That you became a bitch, only you are to blame
And in the end I wish nothing changed
[Pre-Chorus: fewmet & TG]
I think that I am numb to love
Are we trying again because I'm ready to give up

[Chorus: fewmet]
I don't even know if its fair anymore
You don't even know if you care anymore
Life's fucked up and you know it
I gave you my heart then you broke it
Aye, fuck love 1 time
Fuck love 2 times
Fuck love another time

West coast killa, ain't no one illa
Wanna fuck with me, then get ready for the thrilla
This song is for vibes, this song is for chills
Wonder why it’s fire, cause I made it on a grill
Real, that’s the keyword
Never come up yellow like big bird
Like James Bond, I’ll make you shaken not stirred
I’ll make you wish you never interfered
Year by year, that’s how I do
Kiss my ass, that’s all for you

San Fran been there for days
Hayward is my city
This shit is so pretty
This is my first year
And I’m tryna make it big
Driving through the city
Makes me feel big
Helps me get inspired
Smelling that smoke from that cig
Homeless people out in streets
No new clothes, no food to eat
Momma hated growing here
No freedom, no release
And she felt so alone
Sadness, no perfect home
Hated school wanted to work
Wanted money and the perks
Now I can see where I get my grind
Throw myself into mankind
Rap just helps me unwind
Heart and brain combined
Make it high, never resign
This mixtape, my first design
Feel the power and the heat
Emanating from this beat
Helps me feel, I can pass sky
Makes me feel like that type of guy
But I can’t be shy, I gotta brave
This rap shit is the stuff I crave

Think I'm not hurt
Think I'm not mad

Love is just a game to you
For your own fucking fame
I had to say that it's pretty lame
So don't try to come back now
You're in the past
Cause if you really
Were here with me, you would've stayed
Never left through all the times
Hurt and down
I still get up, and make it through
Still alive

So all of you

Lemme show you what we finna do

We never follow suit
Just destroy your hollow crew

Without a clue, you are

And I'm speakin like Yoda
Cause I'm the master coder
Like a hidden windows folder

You really can't see me
With more choices than evolvin an evee
And that one was a freebie
Movin past the 3D

Into the 4th dimension, which is time
Im waitin for a sign
I only borrow divine designs of rhyme
When I need to
Shout out the guru
You cannot do what I do

Which is cite my sources
I'm movin endorphins with silent enforcement
Never lookin for an endorsement
Just lookin for a portion of a portion
While I keep my reality in proportion
On the daily tryna to keep my point of view without distortion

Zeetus lupetus
Got an army of dead babies, you cannot defeat us

Did you get the pun?
I'm only doin this shit for fun

If you focused on the rats
You ain't never finna see the snakes in the grass

So I take these wack cats snapbacks
And snap chats
And slap that
To the back of the pack
And eat em like a snack pack
Mindfulness is key

If you tryna rock with piety
I am not a deity
But I'm rockin much too easily
For me to be

Anything less than the best
As I kick it to your chest, i be

Coolin with my dogs like
Dr.. Armond
While your lyrics are cheesy, call you papa john

Keep my lyrical style in shape like an octagon
I am the dada with a prefix of don
And my word is bond


Aw hell naw
Who you think can
Simultaneously work a daw
And keep it raw
You can't see what I saw
Around this muhfucker I am the law
I beat the maw
On legendary
I'm so raw its scary
I carry these varied
Vowels and consonants
Only rockin with you cause I'm way too dominant
Inside a punett square
And it's really not fair
How I kick these rhymes to ya dome
Ain't nobody home?
Tryna reach you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you.......

And your whole crew posse gang
Just let the shit bang
Most rappers can't hang like an orangutan
When I step inside the party
I'll have you sayin goddang it bobby
But you know the name
It is Raul juke
And I came to verbally puke
On the jam
Goddamn
Only droppin bars
Never eatin them

Only spit em out
Never put them in
Never catch me eatin vicodin
I'd rather eat some vitamins
Take a nap, then rock the mic again
Or make a beat
Cause I keeps production neat
I am the mc you cannot defeat
I mastered beats and rhymin
When timin triplet syllables
For minimal criminals
Shout out krs
For the residual
Rhymes that im kickin
Oh so finger lickin
Droppin it like it was an egg
And i was a chicken
Your pocket im pickin

[Verse 1 - Alfonso]
I'm Alfonso - didn't have a lot of fun, bro!
Didn't get the one ""oh-so-hard-to-get"" damn championship!
I thought each year: ""I could have it"", ooh
I changed teams six times, can't handle it
I'm so fast and lit, I had plans to quit in '14 after 2 titles
Matched all my rivals - kinda got entitled towards the end

Yeah... it's been a tough ride
Became a tough guy
Now Honda really fucks my choices up
I've been voicing what I shouldn't
Whatever, man, GP2 engine sucked anyway

So I don't give a fuck now. I think back 12 years and just how
I would have been champ if I stayed at McLaren, but I didn't
Can't even cope with how bad it drove
The '08 Renault and '09 was just a yoke
Ohhh, Alonso doesn't wanna come again
'Cause Renault doesn't even like my plans
And I know, and I know, and I know I burned some bridges
But all the things I said, I said in jest

[Verse 2 - Gangsta Guenther]
Well, I don't fucking give a fuck about nobody anymore, really...
What I saw from sponsors and from drivers made the team feel unlucky
Why do bad things happen to the best people?
With all the bad happened to me, one would think I'm evil

Haas deserves 4th place and stability
And a pit crew with a consistent ability
We don't want a situation at the season opener
Like '18 or '19, '17 was much doper!

Guenther has the fucking power, the fuck smash!
I consider renaming the team from Haas to Hash
I'm so tired of dealing with broken doors and crashes
But I'm strong, so Haas will rise from the ashes

[Verse 1]

Hi it’s me
Rhyming since ’93 so if you’re just finding me now, a lot of rewinding to be done
To get caught up on the catalog
Not a moment to lose so get crackin’ dawg
I’ll try to give you the time you need
But also need to mindful of these
Fine peeps who are now my side seats
I’m a dirty little snot nosed rhyming geek
But really not much has changed
Seems stranger--s to arrange
Words into rhyming manner time and grammar, hittin’ ya harder than a diamond hammer
And cos I’m dropping jewels
Well at the same time droppin’ fools
Who can’t breathe this rarefied air
Not enough of O2 in the atmosphere
To support their little bitty baby lungs
Which [w]ill quickly collapse in the face of drums
The lights the deeds
Meantime my mic light green
Which of course means that it’s go time
I rrr-rock under pressure like a coal mine
Excavating gems and devastating M…Cs
[Cs], who can’t breathe puny fleas alliterated with ease
‘til I’m standing alone on a precipice ingested with pestilence of eloquence
That I’ve reaped below
Making speakers glow
Bright green from being radio toxic
Fuck pop, shit on the radio toxic
Over beat be the job descripti[s]on I’m clearly one of the top picks
In this chosen field
So, you know the deal
Shut the fuck up and let the grown-ups talk, eat your fruit roll ups and your soda pop
Perhaps even blow a bubble or two
But stay at the kids table nobody is through
And speaking of through, I’m through ‘til verse two
Format it’s all you

I woulda happily left this godforsaken track to 1 verse, until format was like
“nah give ‘em their money’s worth”
Psh
Yeah easy for him to say
He just loops shit up and presses play
I’m the one here writing for days to a 130 BPM beat; you fucking crazy
And that’s just writing: Reciting’s worse
This lighting verse has literally shortened my life on Earth
So please enjoy my ultimate sacrifice
Other rappers not even half as nice
And you know that’s the truth
Man, they better stay the fuck out my booth man
Cos that’s hallowed ground
Quicksand swallowing your shallow sound
Never to be seen again I mean it man
The blood from weaker MC’s what feeds my pen which means that when every time I puts that pen to sheet well then
It’s a bloody bloodbath blood
Like a hemophiliac stub-bin his baby toe on a cactus
In dire need of some coagulant
But I switched the packaging
To some blood thinner and so I’m cackling
Here in the corner maniacally, cos the truth is even when I try to be
All peace and love
I still fiend for blood
It’s just the MC in me bud that instinctively leads me to feast on scrubs
So, don’t come around when I’m peckish or risk ending up as my breakfast
And next it’s heavy dental flossin’ to clean all the MC flesh that’s caught
In-between my pearly whites turned ruby red from these murderous bites
Inflected on persons reciting shitty verses on mics
Of which of course there’s no shortage
So, you know I stay gorgeous

Quiet Sphere/ dusk,rap,Rav,2017,639,{},"[Quiet Sphere]
I need some food for thought, no need to diet here
I need some room for love, or else I'll die in here
It's quiet clear that the silence feeds the mind this time of year
So I despair once I'm prepared to rot inside this quiet sphere
How my autopilot always pick the higher gear?
When the talking turns to something neither you or I would share
Angry freestyled thoughts are venomous in nature
I get scared when faced with an iron stare with real hurt behind the layers
I want us to leave our jobs, I want us to leave this town
In this sea of sadness, we swim or we gon' drown
We will ignore the others butting in with their opinions
'Cause we see nothing in them, and we don't fuck around

[dusk]
Is the light of dawn worth storm each dusk?
Clearly once I thought it was
Maybe I'm not me from then no more, 'cause now it's awfully tough
Used to think I helped you when the anger moods would shower you
Now I have the feeling I'm the one that brings that out of you
Maybe it's a bit of both, I admit I make it worse
I can't shake this feeling that together we can't shake this curse
I don't wanna break what works, but I don't wanna work what's broke
Tell me what you want for once, please tell me what hurts you most
Never do I feel prepared to let you go
It pains thus, when I close my eyes and recollect the memories that made us
Can we make it work or will it spiral further down?
How will you recall me when I'm no longer around?
You get so frustrated, I get so impatient
We both sitting in the misery of our creation
Perhaps it's far more simple, or maybe complicated
Whatever it may really be, I'm not sure I can take it",3880225,en,en,en

She trying to stunt and trying to front
Like she got attitude
I bet a mill' shе get her thrills all from the altitudе

Gone to hell in handbasket in an afternoon
Still feeling fantastic when she off the absolute

Found the runaways messiah

Hit the boardwalk for the function

Toss our sorrows to the winds
We'd count the sands and call them our successes
Cause then they're endless

We run the streets quiet, cuz the law's biased
Skip the battles back in 86, now niggas tattle, chop crazy bricks
Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich
Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggas in ghettos
Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled
Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin grudges for years
I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes
The sorrow to swallow, I follow my motto
Squeeze first, since the day I slung, ready rockin a bottle

Make ya niggas start to worry cuz my hood is dark and blurry
When shots flurry, niggas point guard like Marbury
Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting
Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining
I've seen you niggas come up quick and then fall
I've seen you frontin for your broad like her pussy's the bomb
Clowns findin their stash gone but my cash is long
So I'mma let y'all pass on, cuz you ass like a thong

I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed
I dead niggas like Pac and BIG, blocks to live
These niggas can't eat like hostages
Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords
I rob niggas like the Crips at the Source Awards
And everything that went down was cool with me
As long as I came back with my jewelry
We had machine guns, I think we had two or three

You can recycle my rhymes for a life time
Stay reciting my lines through the pipeline

What if we were part of things bigger and bright

Bruise and batter me but you’re never shooting stabbing me

All we did was stimulate set off our endorphins
Trans morphing after five failed abortions
My thoughts get born in real word contortion

Moving below to obtain the jewels and free dome

Curving the continuum doing the work of crafters
That serve the masses dreams are broken the earth is shattered

Spaghettification through dimensions I learn to gather
Information further static cause the first reactors
To ignite the nothingness and then burst the blasters

Can't push my button unless you starting my engine
And I don't really go out too much no more
Cause the new crib so damn big I went missing

Feels good to live a little bit, doesn't it?
I give her Mickey D and she screams ""I'm lovin' it"" (oh baby)
And I feel like Leo, behind the wheel, yeah bitch I'm revvin it
Got no chill, but I'm frio, get lit for the hell of it
Living the life, sleep when I die
On that, liquor tonight, my limit is high
Right now, I'm on a vibe, give me the light
Oh no, I shouldn't drive, give me a ride
You think I'm slipping hell nah, au contraire
Got the money gotta tell me that it's all there
You ain't hitting what I'm pitching Bumgarner
Other side of the line cause it's not fair, aw yeah

Hothead but I'm cooler than New England

I got no more tears in me left to flow
Since I did my baby wrong
She left me lonely for so long

Now I'm out here on my own
Lord won't you please bring my baby home?

Lord won't you please
Bring my baby home
Lord won't you please bring my baby home?

It goes one for the treble
Two for the bass
Used to mess with this girl way back in the day
She was from the peace days and she went both ways
Yea, the girl was a freak
I used to call her Monique
And before we even spoke about knockin' the boots
She said her names been changed to avoid law suits
So now wer'e gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty
She brought her friend 'round and DAMN she was pretty!
Betty was twisted
Said her number was listed
Grabbed my love two fisted
Hugged and kissed it
She said ""one in the hand is worth two in the bush""
But when push came to shove yo I had my own theories

World series of love
It's two on one
When I got caught with a smokin' gun
His wifey came home and she bursted in
Now I'm lookin' for my heart like it's made from tin

The road that I travel ain't got yellow bricks
My old woman thinks that all men are pricks
Then she flipped the script
She's puttin' lip to lip
Everytime I think about it I just lose my grip

I've been up and I've been down
I've been high and I've been low
I've been square and I've been round
I've been fast and I've slow
I've been cool and I've been calm
I've been kind and I've been crass
I held the whole world right in my palm
I tried to spread it around but it sure went fast

Yeah, making diagrams with all this jam it
I got a girl name Bonnie
Honest like Abraham, I'm a pirates fan
So I'ma about to write ya another stanza, oooh
So I'ma about to recruit
When it looked rough people went aaachhuuu!
(Chill) Bitches on my head about to be a baby boom
But these girls think I'm cute from my head to my shoes, thank my mama
People stare at my teeth, but I make it hard for them to breath
And that is the fucking truth
Woah I'm spittin like a goof
Who would expect I'd end up a recluse
I ain't have a warden, I fly like me jordan
I don't like flu's, but people mock my performance
So much vision is more like a burden
Yeah, I've been replayin, I begin conveyin
Since I've wrote these lines, sittin in my room
With these thoughts when hangin with them gangsters
Let's go back to when moms and me was releashin angers, uhh
Yeah, that's why I'm disguised in, huh?
A promise with all this fungus
Shit, I moved from my city
Tryna get my ma's to move wit me
Fuck the free world, you gon' miss me?

Godfather V,rap,V-Sharp,2019,63,{},"[Verse 1]
Awaiting my response I ain’t gone just yet
It’s a long way before my car will stop and dread
I won’t park unless I finished the job I led
I promise I’ll come back harder than ever
I’m a dog but I’m not the one to guard and fetch
I’m the opposite I’ll go bark and sketch a plot
Against the robber who barged in set
Now my thoughts are headed in the wrong direction
Your goals so low ain’t got no bar to set
And it’s oh so cold you gon’ starve to death
Sharp ain’t a metaphor I chop and shred
The race ain’t over yet you claim you got the bread
You should thank me man I bring the spark in men
If this is an argument, you just lost again
You only know me as a person who you saw as a friend
You ain’t never seen the Godfather yet man

[Verse 2]
I don’t need gold to go start a trend
You don’t have an edge even with the sharpest pen
Regardless of who’s finna cross the end
I’m the boss inevitably I’m blossoming
You’ve made another song you think you marked a dent
It’s no attack in reality my heart feels blessed
And I crave competition bring it on my friend
You aim at me then I guess I am your target then
[Verse 3]
Now I did this with a reason ain’t no profiting
When I’m talking respect my conglomerate
From the tone of your voice I see you are depressed
Go to the doctor don’t act like you’ve been popping meth
I would never have the intent to harm unless
You falsely express yourself beyond extent
All you said was nearly all a stretch
You been climbing in the wrong ladder watch your step

[Verse 4]
It was clearly discreet in my speech and actions
That this ain’t no beef it’s just me who’s rapping
I believe you can’t see go get some reading glasses
Cause you’re easily offended by your key distraction
The only way you’ll beat me or meet my standards
Is paying close attention in your english classes
There will be a time where you gon’ meet me after
The way you’ll address me will be “greetings master”
I don’t steal the beats it’s called a remix asshole
Whoops sorry man I didn’t mean to use bad words
I’m navigating through your mind like a CT scanner
Piece by piece I’ll go deep in your planner
And leave your body completely shattered
A complete disaster now I’ll leave you stranded
Memories are flashing now you’re here and it’s happening
I ain’t Slim Shady I’m just a seed he planted
I ain’t MGK you perceived it backwards
Even the rats will tell you to clean your act up
Obedience that’s not something they teach in class and
Just know you can’t foresee the end before reading my chapter
[Verse 5]
My every lyric spitted got an inner meaning in it
Forbidden spit the formidable been bitten by villains
I obliterate any inconsiderate idiot living
This an infinite warfare I’m not restricted by limits
You’ve said lies go rinse your mouth with the bleachers
Jesus Christ how do I describe the features
Of this weakling who hardly has the feet to reach up
This is your epiphany now come plead to this genius

[Verse 6]
Yeah I did my annotations so that people could see
I’m superior lyrically and you’re way beneath me
Your words are squashed in between like a washing machine
When you read between my lines a horoscope appears
I’ll forecast defeat before you open your screen
I’ve slain many Mc’s before you were here
I entertain my enemies while they shiver in fear
You ain’t the first muttonhead to be coming at me
Just know the lion comes single when he hunts for his meat
Last week I got recognized by RapTV
My heart is steel I’m the real deal reel my flashback
You a prick acting like I stuck a needle up your asscrack
I’m an underground thug I could handle grenades
It’s so sad your redemption only lasted a day
[Verse 7]
Battle’s delayed bastard you’ll never surpass my display
You a dime dropper I’m standing here laughing and saying
That you ain’t gonna make it past my array
You don’t have enough praise to come back at me late
Go to sleep no wake up you’ve been dreaming this nonsense
I don’t regret what I did no guilty conscience
Self esteem not ego is what we don’t have in common
I could freestyle better if this was even a contest

[Verse 8]
You a master in what ranting and babbling junk
Don’t call yourself a rapper just by adding a cuss
I’m a PhD in this while you a crap in the mud
Go grab your keys and scram and leave the rapping to us
You spit a half a minute more but that don’t matter as much
Because it’s the message sent that attacks and it rubs
All over you like rashes it attaches like pus
I could snap my fingers and you’ll be catching the bus
Your song was good but I’m clapping my hands only once
This ain’t a massive attack it’s just a candle I touched
You trying to provoke me and make a pacifist budge
Your rhymes are trash while mines are worth a platinum budget
You brag about having more rapid slap when you punch
You don’t remember what happened in the rap battle at lunch
You’re just taking my words regurgitating it back
While I’m just being a true player stating the facts",4566649,en,en,en
Our Revels Now Are Ended,rap,Akira The Don,2018,432,"{""Alan Watts""}","The fact that life is transient
Is part of its liveliness
The poets in speaking of the transience of the world always utter their best poetry

You know?
Our revels now are ended
These are actors as I foretold you are all spirits
And are melted into air
Into thin air

And like the baseless fabric of this vision
The cloud-capp’d towers
The gorgeous palaces
The solemn temples
The great earth itself
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind

We are such stuff as dreams are made of
We are such stuff as dreams are made of
We are such stuff as dreams are made of
And our little life
Is rounded in a sleep
And said so well it doesn't seem so bad after all does it

You see
There is always, in the poetry of Evanescence a kind of funny nostalgia
Moralists will say
Those lovely lips which you so delighted to kiss today
Will in a few years rot and disclose the grinning teeth of the skull
So what?
The skull says
Lying in the grass
Chattering, finch and water fly are not merrier than I
Here among the flowers I lie laughing everlastingly
No

It was hid so carefully",5018869,en,en,en

So scared from these nightmares, sweat through sheets
So I sweat through beats, achieve true peace
Only get one life, just signed a new lease
All I need is one mic, and a few blues beats
Cook the [?] cool beans
Cut my muse loose, tantalized by the amuse [?]
She be [?] guess we will soon see
Revert back to the loop, repeat
These two feet face the beamer
So I can pay my dues due east
Whatever’s a crew, levers are pulled
My methods are genuine, pedalling through
Malevolent ooze, pep in my step
Getting me to the next plateau
Assessing the view, weather when the elements
No, not for the hell of adventuring
The meditation to better diffuse with training duke
In a sentimental mood
My family’s the engine, keeps me revving
As I’m stepping on the accelerator
To what’s ahead of me, let’s cruise
Shaking a etch-a-sketch of the blooper
And it’s all nuance, a conceptual reiteration of the next move
Its obsessive or repressive propensity, a propeller perpetually ascending
And became fine-tuned, these birds eye views reaffirm what I do
Tonight’s sky so solemn as I glide through it

Told the truth and the lie, I figured let ‘em guess

Don’t wait and say it after I death

Far be it man, far be it

Life is full of mysteries, and I'm just trying to solve these riddles
Can't even enjoy Arizona Tea and bag of Skittles
Trying to be my kid's hero
Not just an iconic rap figure, either way I'm just a nigga
Some folks size with soul; feels dark even when the sun does shine
I think I got a problem, I should really take care of this
But I'm careless
Last five years, Dr. Cuevo's been my therapist
So damn drunk, I can't drive to the lab
And they cutting hours at work, so I can't afford a cab
But I can cop another bottle, right?
Twenty seven and I still ain't got my priorities right
Feel like Denzel in Flight
But I'm still in control of life
When it seems I'm about to crash
Mama raised me well, so I know I'll be alright
Yeah, I know I'll be alright

Rumble, young man, rumble
May your courage overcome the fear
Rumble, young man, rumble
You're a lion, your time is here
Rumble, young man, rumble
You’re the lightning, the storm is near
You may slip and stumble
But Rumble, young man, rumble

Close, my, eyes, and hope for better days
Give me, the strength, to say what I could never say
Keep, me, hum-ble, but still ambitious
Calm my soul, but leave me vicious

[Verse 1] (Duzzo & Shyazzy)
I've grown so much
But I can still revert
To make every last one of your fucking feelings hurt
To stop the world from spinning and make it feel inert
To freeze time in its tracks and it will reverse
And this verse could get me killed but I kill a verse
Rhyming at million motherfucking kilohertz
Whether I was killed or murdered
When the wheel the hearse, out
And fill the dirt
Into the hole in the earth
Where the casket's placed
A basket case
Still, Straightjacket laced
And if the songs not better than the last at least
Then we can’t release it
It's gotta be a masterpiece
Cause I gotta be the stitches in the mouths of the bitches who doubt me
Spit on my name and count me outtie
Spend the whole damn day runnin' their mouth about me
But they wouldn't have much to talk about without me, AHHHHH
I walk a line
That's way too thin
And if I give up now
It means I let you win
So fuck that
With a capital F-U
The beast has been unleashed, I'm an animal let loose
The jungle left me numb
And I'm tumbling through the troubled times
Stumbled a couple times
And my empire is crumbling to rubble
It's fumbling, In my jumbled mind
But there’s a voice up, in my bubble
That keeps telling me to rumble
[Chorus] (Duzzo)
Rumble, young man, rumble
May your courage overcome the fear
Rumble, young man, rumble
You’re a lion, your time is here
Rumble, young man, rumble
You're the lightning, the storm is near
You may slip and stumble
But Rumble, young man, rumble
Close, my, eyes, and hope for better days
Give me, the strength, to say what I could never say
Keep, me, hum-ble, but still ambitious
Calm my soul, but keep me vicious
[Verse 2]
(Shyazzy)
Back with my back against the ropes
On the attack like a pack of wolves
But the pride and the passion’s uncrackable
The task at hand is rash. I'm an animal   (Shyazzy)
(Duzzo)
Sometimes it feels like it's
Rainin', pourin’
Agent Orange
In a ragin' storm and
You came in roaring
Like a Lion, fighting
Scraping, clawing!
Spread your wings like a raven soarin'
Feel like God is trying my will -- testing me
And I could turn back now or fulfill my destiny
So if you're looking for a place to put your faith in
Invest in me
Rest in peace
To the old me. The new me is out for blood
Until I'm lying there breathlessly   (Duzzo
( Shyazzy)

In the jungle, let him be! Let him be!

Or a Rumble in the Jungle

Will You Be Remembered,rap,Kinetics,2011,2014,"{""Missy Modell""}","[Hook: Missy Modell]
Looking back, at what we've done
How will you feel, about what we've become
Would you want to turn around
Would you want to be the one who is known
For doing everything that everyone just talked about
Will you be remembered

[Verse 1: Kinetics]
Or will you be forgotten
If a storm was coming would you do something to stop it
If you had a bottle you'd probably pop it
And if you knew that bottled water in the third world is not even an option
Deep pockets, would you ball out
Or listen to the cries of those that call out
Why we all about trying to stay fly
When the things with the wings are falling out of the sky (yea, why)
And when they land inside an odyssey
Will you be the one to spoil corporate royalty
And as the world is boiling and you have to evacuate
Tell me what will happen when a bag is all that you will have to take
So knowing half will break, and only some will stand
Would you grab a backpack or somebody's hand
Look, I don't want to criticize
I'm just asking you all to take a minute to visualize

Cause you don't have to be forgotten
For every flower rotting another one of them blossoms
They can be blocking policies, but never block democracy
The marble obviously opted on top of autocracy
And these will be the songs that are children hear
Don't you want to tell them how we made a killing here
How we pushing 23 year-old billionaires
How we put a black man in a white building, yea
So when they say that our fate is debatable
Ask them to find a generation more ready than capable
And I promise if I ever turn around
It will only be so I can take a bow, singing now
We gonna make it, we gonna make it
If one shot left then we gonna take it
And we gonna have a toast to be the best in the book
It's not the position you stand, it's the direction you look
[Hook: Missy Modell]
When they look back
Will you be the one they talk about
So will you turn around
Would you want to turn around
Will they look back and remember
Looking back, at what we've done

Would you want to turn around
Would you want to be the one who is known

Yeah yeah
I'm trying to get through to you, you don't listen
Just hear me out

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
You're too young to look that tired, too sweet to be that sad
Any moment it all could end, so please treat the day like your last chance
I know that's family that you're caring for, I know you're feeling so obligated
I ain't saying don't help at home but your sister's son, you ain't gotta raise him
You sacrificed your life, when she wouldn't even sacrifice her night
You babysitted, playing with him, when she wasn't acting right
Don't you got your own dreams, own goals, it ain't right that you gotta put them on hold
You went to school but now you don't go because you're scared she's gonna leave him home alone
You walking in the crib and she passed out again
Your nephew crying on the floor, his ass is out again
Because she done smoked up all the diaper money
And so you laugh to keep from crying trying act as life is fucking funny
And I know when you showing them love that you're just trying to help
But your life will be passing you by if you don't get it done for yourself
And the way that you're doing it now I'm afraid that it's affecting your health, because you're living for somebody else

They don't want you to leave, they want you to stay
But you should be pulling away if nobody is pulling they're weight
And it's okay, you wanna live a little in your own way
Maybe you would get your bills payed if you didn't have to pay for her mistakes
Yeah, and you ?, you worry about them, you're terrified
And you're scared to move like you're paralyzed, and the guilt will eat you like a parasite
She living all reckless, going on benders acting offensive, right
And you've given up friendships, given up men, you've given up every night
And you've given up paychecks, and you pay the rent just save them
She complicating your life because she wanna act so damn basic
And you take it because you want approval
Don't you know that they wanna use you, don't you know that it'll ruin you
And you gotta leave, it ain't wrong to do you
And I know when you showing them love that you're just trying to help
But your life will be passing you by if you don't get it done for yourself
And the way that you're doing it now I'm afraid that it's affecting your health, because you're living for somebody else

It ain't about what you will do or you won't do
But are you willing to do, anything that he want to
Because he don't want you, he want you to just run through, many men, plenty sin, pretty slim chance he'll hold you
He tells you that you're beautiful, he tells you that you're fine
He tells you to go hit the strip and go flip a trick for them dimes

Plus a couple shots of this and she'll go do it for a hunned
She's a young girl, young girl, no class, dumb girl
But that don't mean you can't change, and that don't mean you're done girl
And I told her ""Little mama don't lower yourself to be a esteemed.""

Am I going slow
Am I going fo'
Something that ain't mine
Like this life that i claim
Do we just do it for fame
Or do we do it for gain
We resurrect our flesh
Instead of leaving slain

See I just captured your interest
Or do you live by opinions
Or do you live by your feelings
Instead of faith through the ceiling

And how was I really doubting
When i was fully surrounded
With evidence all around us
Stagnant like couches in lounges
How do we expect our heart to be a heart of gold
Instead of looking to the Truth we buy the lie and sell our soul
I remember puffing something you drink, in yellow pages
Praying to God day to day that one day I wanna be famous
Or how I went through the Internet searching for pornography
I tended to look to the device instead of the potter
We, are the pottery, man I was living in hypocrisy
Compared to him we're just a particle of a droplet see

[Chorus]

I'm moving in godspeed
All these haters tryna stop me
But they don't know
I'm moving godly
[×2]

[2nd Verse] Bee Da Unique


Condescending
Man I didn't get it
What was repentance
Do you need attendance
To be a Christian
If you didn't get it
Then don't sweat it
Just  check this
I was alive to myself
Alive with some pride could've died to myself
Alive, wanna fly, with no sight, i need help
Before I sky dive and hit my head on the shelf

Never put your faith in a man
Never put your faith in a woman or your man
Never put your faith in your own forged plans
But put your faith the one The Great I AM

By killing the messanger don't think that you you will be killing the message
Flexing with Gucci,Versace things from CBD now what will you flex with
Some people's motives for wearing em' is just to be getting attention
I can kill the flow like a river though you just need to be attentive

Now I just gave you a piece of me
You can go the Jesus, The Prince of Piece
Forever it will remain, there's only one king
Surrender is better than resistance, that's one thing

[Chorus]
I'm moving in godspeed
All these haters tryna stop me
But they don't know
I'm moving godly
[×2]
Im moving in godspeed
All these haters tryna stop me",3454130,en,en,en

[Verse]

On  a bright sunny day, in the morning

I was chilling with my homies in the corner

Everybody was cool, smoking weed, telling jokes

But they knew that something was coming 

It was snakes all around me, I was the real one

All of them niggas were cunning

I was the richest among them, so I told them

""I will die for y'all,I will ride for y'all, I will fight for y'all
So no worries, and if y'all need money just call me""

And they told me ""Bro we got you, if they fuck with you

They fuck with us, if they beef with you, they beef with us""

But little did I know they were fronting

One of them had a call on the phone

And thеn he picked it up and then hе went aside 

And then he started off talking

He was still on the phone and a nigga came through

Put his hands in his pants, pull out a gun and took two

Shots to my chest

And then, I fell to the ground, I was crawling in the ground

I was soaked in blood and regrets

All my niggas ran away they fled
I was still breathing and my blood bleeding

Man! I can't believe this, how could they leave me

Where them real niggas at!  where them real niggas at

And then I heard the siren blowing

It was resuscitation and police

And that was all I remembered till I woke up in a hospital

Two weeks later, I was out of the hospital

And I was invited for interrogation

But i did not wanna snitch on the homies



[Dialogue]

Officer:     So, Mr. Corporate, can you enlighten us

                   on how the incident went down?
Narrator:  Uh, I was out in a open place

                   chilling with a bunch of random people 

                   and someone with a mask walked up to me, 

                   pulled out a gun from his pants and then

                   shot me two times, like it happened so fast

Officer:     Ok, so do you know or suspect anybody

                   from these bunch of random people

Narrator:  Nah, I d, I d, I d, I don't, I don't, I don't suspect

Mastered the flow from the east to the west, but right now I'm wondering how trill is this, I
Been around for a minute now, one hunnid, I'm in it now
People that wasn't there back in the day talkin' 'bout, man, remember I'm winning now

First off
I give a fuck about all that top five, if I ain't in it
Niggas barely ever play my records (It don't matter), but I'm still winnin'
From the M-I-crooked just to make 'em peep what I'm cookin', I love Mississippi
I put a studio in my partner kitchen, so by the way I'm whippin'
You would think I'm juggin' these hoes
Cuttin' crack and make 'em double back like excuse me, nigga
I need a stove, nah, I ain't selling dope
But this a metaphor for my flow
But I'ma probably have to hit with a fork (Maybe dumb it down)
'Til it bubble up and then rise some more
So I can bag it up for these Insta folk
And sell it for the low 'cause they simple ('Cause they simple)
If I hear, ""KRIT, you need a hit"" one more time
Lookin' at us like, ""How these motherfuckers gon' undership mine?""
Still do an interview here and there
Where they don't even know that I'm signed
(Nigga you had to know that)
If I wait on the label to support my vision I might go blind
Lately I've been on my tell it all get rich
Start plottin' on my way I did
To show like Empire may the very thing I dreamed of look like bullshit
Kill em all, why not, King when I'm busy
Krizzle up in the blizzard and the cold is the [?]
Said who was here, never really snowed in the sizzie
Fuck what ya heard, multi 'til I dizzie, bitch

A'ight, check it (Yeah, yeah)
It's the take, I heard y'all been checking my net worth
What the fuck is y'all doing? Y'all ain't on my level
Boy, go pay your rent first
And then maybe I'll sign you, I'm looking for talent, I hope that I find you
""Wait a minute, you asked me now let me tell you. Now here's another problem""
They probably expecting that shit for the first album, man, fuck that
They'll say that I changed, and I'll say I had to show 'em my range
'Cause if I do what I did then they'll say it's the same
Just can't win in this game (Yeah, yeah)
""What's wrong with it ?"" A'ight, yeah, uh
Money talks, that's a figure of speech, that went over their head
Like the dough that I throw in the air like I'm Papa John
That mafia money, that Parmigian'
My shortie a dime, your bitch is a nine
Pennies, prolly take her to Dennys, we chillin' at Lenny's
You know I got 99 problems, but keep it a hunnid, you know that I done it
Just me and my homies, we tryna make it to the summit
Praying that we don't plummet
Like, ""Oh my God, look at your boy, now you finally done it""
I've been writing these records from actual facts
So hopefully you learn something from it, but what I learned is

Handzum deity from the O-H
Rozz turn a hot head into a cold case
Beating up the block with the trunk fulla bass
And my lungs filled up with indica to keep me in my place
I smoke a hundred joints when I wake up
I make a pot of coffee then I smoke a hundred more to stay up
I been going dumb like it's my nature
All I wanna do is sacrifice the vapor of the rice paper
Rozz take the finest tone
Put her on tha track and make a toast
I wouldn't even give her
Anything more than a half a bite of government cheese at the most
Dylan got game like wizards of the coast
Young Jake Jeckel with the flame let em roast
Anybody ever wanna go and make another threat at me or anybody that I'm with me will get chose
Plucked off in the map in the race
Dylan never gotta put the millimeter in they face
Walking in-between the rows of the cornstalk state thats me R O Double Z from the O-H
I don't give a fuck about anything other than achieving everything I want cause everybody said I can't
I don't give a damn about anything other than the knowledge of divinity inspired by the weed grams

Early mornin' making dough
Let the fucking bass go
Got my rizla 8 rolled
Smoking till my face cold

Ah yes just like you I do prefer a funky bass tone
Dylan still murderin with our lock alternative draped all over my frame ho
Young Jake with the frown and the flame ho
I do not have any anger
But as soon as I step in the place everything in my vicinity is in danger
Bitch if you wanted to get you a lesson in pimpin' hit me on my pager
Then I'll put your face in the dirt and hit it from the back
So hard when I'm done you'll be a hater
All I wanna do is smoke in solitude
Until I vanish and no one can find me as I decay into nature
Rozz ain't got time for human nature
I do not have any time to dedicate to any distractions from my paper
Thats why I can do what I do at the rate that I do it and you can not fathom

Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone
With Rover the dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around cause I'm serious
What did you call me for cause I'm curious
Or did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I didn't come just to take up space
The night is right, and the stars are bright
So c'mon now brother just treat me right
And just take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can SWING
I don't smoke and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love well that would be a lie
Because I do every chance I get
But if I don't I won't fall I won't fret
I'm no fool I got plenty of sense
So I just be cool, and have patience
Make up your mind, please let me know
And when you give me the green that's when I'll go
So please pretty boy don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
You tried the rest and I tried the best
And when the time comes boy no regrets
And just take it off
Now take off your hat, untie your shoelace
And after you finish, I want you to face me
Now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other girls so don't compare me
Tender lovin care is all I give
And if possible boy, well I would like to live with you
And if I do it ain't everybody's business
It seems to me ya just how you got into this
Take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I seen this dude who was built very well
Face was handsome, body was fine
How did I know, I was cruisin behind him
Looked at the car, looked at me
Then he asked me my name, I told him Lyte the MC but
I didn't want to outplay my hand
So I talked so smooth he could understand me
He was definitely the move
I only said sweet things, that could soothe him
Opened up the door, and he got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told him take it off - I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can swing
I mean take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby until the last drop
Met this guy at an amusement park
He was good to go and it was after dark
You can guess girls what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time baby
Instead the boy asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and he said, ""Never mind.""
When the time come and it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign don't make a difference only how you make love to me
You make me feel so good you're a man
Oooh baby I melt like cotton candy
If I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and I'd also be your wife
So let's take a bout through the tunnel of life
Because you know what I'm thinkin of..

Take it off
Take it off
That's right, now take it off
Take it off

Those fucking nostril holes the size of fucking soccer goals
Shit, they said don't play around with ICE he real as hell
But there's something 'bout Battle Of The Bay that make me feel myself
You planning on doing three rounds about killing me well I don't need your help
Cause if I'm your age and still battle rapping I'll fucking kill myself
So this what all the rah rah about?
C'mon man I wanted to find out what Harlem about
Started to feel like I should've held out for a larger amount
Man I fucking hate these New Yorkers, R's ain't that hard to pronounce
Shit, only thing I hate than ICE is white people that pretend to know what the fuck he be talking about
Did y'all know, in America, every 30 seconds a new Smack rapper blog comes out?
VLADTV , your salty ass all on the couch
Talking us down, starting to understand why Math got socked in his mouth
I would start marking him out, but he look like a dude who tells
I'll desert him in broad daylight/Daylyt with that boo boo smell
All you hear is that ""tu-tu"" get your frame decorated in deuce deuce shells
You the biggest bitch on stage since Nu Nu Nellz
I'm sorry ICE, thought you was gonna beat Caustic, right?
Not tonight, he cool, let's see how fucking cool he is with a blade lodged in his windpipe
I'll send ransom notes to Harlem, let 'em bargain for his life

I said I'll stomp you out til your soul hollow
You be on the floor looking up to me like a role model
I'll put y'all ass back in the ground, you an old fossil
Plus I'm shining your top like a Patron bottle
I said yo, I said fuck if we cool, I'm going for your throat still
45 battle rapping cause you broke still
If I see wolf in these streets then he road kill
We and ICE not the same I got no chill
I said, so what you gonna do? Compare me to some racist white cop?
Like everything white people have ever done wrong is in someway my fault
Like I wasn't out there with y'all, protesting when the time call
Arm locked, shutting down 580, pepper spray dripping out my eyeballs
So go ahead call me Vanilla Ice or act like I'm Shady, bitch I might go crazy
You be at your 9 to 5, I'll be outside waiting
Do a drive-by? Maybe
Show you that 9-9 then it's bye bye Haiti
I go in ICE house just to knife ICE lady
Ironic how it's a white guy claim to ice ICE baby
And since you talking all that racist shit you gon' pay the price
C'mon man I thought you supposed to be cool you like the same age as Christ

Forgot about the gratification that people gave you

Your overall perception of music is now distorted
And all the great pieces of work you ever recorded
Got disregarded 'cause you feel you haven't been rewarded
All because you got deceived by this fraud biz
And became oblivious to what the real reward is
The true prize is the minute you learn to write
And the change a song can make in a person's life

C'mon, the secret to winnin' is havin' tough skin

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
You get a good idea then fling it into the distance
When what you need to do is speak into existence
And I'm not sayin' that you'll have it in a week
But that status can be reached if you just act on that belief
Some dreams get killed and some die
Most people usually get punked after one try
""You should just give up"" are the words of a dumb guy
Golden opportunities are hard to come by
I won't ever judge at no time
I ain't tryna know ya business to be honest, I don't even wanna know mine
Who will be the winner? Hopefully us
Didn't they tell you, success is supposed to tough
[Chorus: K-Rino]
You might not wanna do it, but ya got to
No one can keep you from it, you're the only person who can stop you
Comprehend, man, we all been on a rough end
The secret to winnin' is havin' tough skin
Tough skin, tough skin
You gotta have that tough skin, tough skin
You gotta have that tough skin, tough skin

Calm down,rap,Angry Mic,2013,92,{},"Verse One:

Do you hear police coming or is it just me bugging?
Doug keeps shrugging and saying he sees nothing

I disagree, fuck him, I'm hiding the trees up in
The green oven, like what if the D's bust in?

Then Doug buts in, ""What did you eat, cousin?""
You mean mugging each muffin, Steve bugging each of them

Speaking to sheep, had 'em begrudging cheap mutton
What the fuck? Is this shit supposed to mean something?

I don't know if suppose to, I'm on a roller coaster
Staring at Hall & Oates poster

Thinking about a lonely poacher in Nova Scotia
I know they coming, sofa hold me closer

Shhh! Everybody calm down

Don't be alarmed if you don't know where you are now

Beyond gone, ain't no wonder why you want out

Be strong, pal, won't be long 'til you calm down


Verse two:

I'm under the bed, puffing on a blunt to the head
I wonder if I'm dead, I summon one of my friends

Then I found myself running from Fred, who filled his stomach with meds
Found a vein and then cut it to shreds

Fuck it, I fled, no discourse with a corpse
I consort but my cohort offers support

We report to the fort that we forged on the porch
Had a ??? ??? shorty escort me of course

Transports me to Mort and he morph to a torch
The floorboards warped, distorted the light source
Mark's all out of sorts, saying George got lost
Of course, he snorts more than fucking Scott Storch

It's a bad mix, ask Chris, spazzed on his last trip
Laughed as he smashed every glass in the cabinet

You fascist, I'll grab the last tab from Travis
Just let me bask in the vastness of acid and

I feel it size me up, time is resigned as I find a Dutch

I wish I could define what my mind constructs

But if I tried to describe, it would rise unjust


Verse three:

There's no reality, gradually I'll travel out the galaxy
With valory, normality's a fallacy
I leave my body because it believes in gravity
See my anatomy? My soul was pulled from outta me

You had to be there, Droseph beware!
There's no clean air, man, don't breathe here

I seem so deserted but please don't disturb it

And I'm pacing back and forth in this room
Mad for all to assume
I am sad but I knew

Adoring his sight and was ignoring the rhymes

Slaughtering mics every morning and night

I am a nightmare
Limitless

To skies clear and lay there for what feels for lightyears
And I say and I pray

I was deserting the writer inside of me
Fired my purpose
Pretty ridiculous the predicament that I was in

I'm an idiot
Bicker and showing the villainous, cold and reptilian flow

When I'm sticking my sixty inch lyrical dick in this beat
When I'm ripping it slow
And I'm sick of me forgetting who the fuck I was
Ditched the bandanna and hoodie for something more fitting
Spent so much time in the gym
Started denying my pen
Became a narcissist and hard this is

And make em want your super thighs, girl you do it right
And you would be the perfect accessory to these high tops
And the way you wear them jeans, can I ride top?
And I can show you what I mean when I say all I do is dream
And we can do the type of things they couldn't show on tv screens
I mean, honestly I feel connections to you
I wish it wasn't so, do you know I heard the rumors?
""Yeah she fucks and goes,"" usually what I'm looking for

I would put you on the shelf with larry and stanley
Cause you a trophy girl, a woman I would marry
If we could only get them clothes off
Then I could go off, call me Wilt, score a hundred, won't stop
And you gon feel it when I hone in

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?

Girl I wanna get you down them skin tights
Get me on the next flight, so that I can get right
I'm packing my birthday suit and I suggest that you pack yours too
And pack your high tops shoes
I wanna see what you look like, in nothing but a new pair of high top hood nikes
You a bad chick, I can tell it
Smilin' like a cutie but with eyes like the devil
Sex demon I'm sex finding I got my text reading
Looking for double entendres and and sex meanings
She use the wordplay, like she mr. a to z, and it's never plain to see
The words she never says to me
What she means, always making me read
Further into things I never knew what I would believe
Givin me the runaround, hard to get, warning
I should be concerned but my concern is can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?

You still think about it, don't deny it
Cautious and curious, you had to try, whatever cause I was buying
Doubted me but I gave you the best ever
And you admitted that you never would've guessed ever
That I could do that, well baby I did it
Got you off and you admitted it was sexually the best feelin
And you came back for seconds
But I ain't ever seen you around and even noticed you textin me
I tried once but to no reply, it's fine, I realize you were given the lie
At the same time, the two us, played by the same dime
Never gonna make the same mistake for a long time
I got my new grind, I got me some new swag
Back on my feet getting heat from some new catch
And she gave me the answer that I wanted

(Verse 2: Bil)
And they try to question my endowment (endowment)
I am the best and my words are the endorsement (endorsement)
My craft is wide flourishing like a ambient
Man I'm heaven sent no reverend to pretend that i ain’t the chosen one
No psychic scent cause truly I am heaven sent
Man I be going on delivering rhymes sicker than STD patients
They keep commenting on my shit not giving me the chance to do my craft
What happened to patience?
Man this is where I came from
To the top is where I go
I ain’t gonna be stopped not even by a leg opened ho
I got shit to focus on that mean more
One day I'll be travellin’ just to make a show, Oh Lawd
I got it in me I know
I'll do all that I can and more I'd walk through the desert sea snow
I heard that they wanna STOP ME, YEAH?!
When it comes to hearing negativity call me Kikazaru
Rap is my shit and for it I'd ride and die too
Not a gang affiliated member nor a Piru
But my rap’s for a rapslap
Shit’s abstract with a twist, a fantasy yet a fact between my ears
Sacred I call it intact
Rhyme master a pro of my act, that’s a fact
I’m fresher than the fall, no leaves attached
I’m all alone till the crack of dawn
Cause being no.1 means no one’s around you
They started copying some of my shit but bitch I found you
And I funded that inspiration that got you to rhyme on a beat cause I'm a rap geek
If that’s what you wanna call me
My pen is my weapon
You can go cry to your priest to drop some verses
Cause my bars will close your doors, annihilate you
You can call yourself deceased (x3)
(Bridge)
Procrastination of your annihilation filled with aspiration
The gasping of your last breath inhaling the depressive thoughts dilating
Dialing the hotline to heaven, no one's answering
Even the angels are not picking up your life's done, time’s up
But Hol' Up, this shit's far from over
Ain't no holding back, we're coming back for that rebound
Ricochetting off off your asses you hating motherfuckers
Venting this anger back at your direction

Part II - The Catch Up

(Verse 3: Bil)
Yeah, N/A
They try to pull me down
Not knowing that they are the fuel that's raising the fire inside me
I've been hardworking long hours even my family can't sight me
It’s not about me
One day it will
But I'm on the road, I'm not talking the highway cause I'd like to take secured steps
On the highway if you get hit that’s one hell of a crash
But the top is where I go
They'll hit the repeat button like it awards free cash
I admit
I did wrong like on Hip-Hop; I overdid the scratch like that track had hell of a rash
But you need to understand
It was my first track
Of course I was nervous; you can call me an amateur
But man I'm evolving
Till one day I'll reach that status of an influential rapper
Then your life I'll be involving
My life is a puzzle, that’s what I'm trying to be solving (x3)
(Verse 4: Aly)
You think you know... Hip-Hop
The struggle is the realest thing that’s out there
Not your average 9 to 5 with regular payday
Definitely not your insipid state of security and regular entertainment
But my love is undeniable, man
I’m keep evolving, till I run out of breath
For evolution is infinite, and
Eternity ain’t enough
Forgive my mistakes
You don’t know what’s at stake here
You got no idea what it’s like to feel failure at what you do best
I’m infinite

We could be together
Eat the peaches off the land

Strawberry lips
Like the way you move
With your apple-bottom hips
By the lake we can take a walk
I can hold your hand
You can tell me all your thoughts
Open up, you can let me in

Say my name one time
So soulful so so soulful
3verses one take, lets go

[VERSE 1]
First you're always calling
Then she's always calling
So much to say to you we could die talking
I mean we could talk, morning to morning
Then you come over and you're moaning in the morning
Let me backtrack for a bit, back to the morning
We were at your friends and you went through my phone and you came across a message that had tears falling
Down your eyes and you asked how could I
Fcuk around like that I mean how would I
No excuses, forget it, I was careless
Girls all around me at the time, I could care less
Good thing's we made it past it, if we didn't?
It'd be me against the woes in the city
Even though I run it from Jos to gidi
I still stay committed to you and my committe
I mean I'm a ref, a veteran and a mess
I had em dumbfounded, my lyrics are def
I'm deeper than most I'm sure you feel the depth
I still made you sweat without breaking a sweat
[Chorus]
Give me all your kisses baby 'cause this is bliss, gimme all your kisses baby
Give me all your kisses baby 'cause this is bliss, gimme all your kisses baby


[VERSE 2]
Allow me make a statement like a preamble
To be a trendsetter you gotta live by example
I'm in the hood with my mans tryna cash out
Even my man bubbles know life is a gamble
Back to the topic, haven't seen you in a minute
My phone got missing and I didn't
Have cheese to get another one ASAP
Guess that explains why of late I've been laid back
But eventually, a phone came through
Tryna get the vibe right but it's not the same boo
You remember the other day you came through
To spin's house and you did some insane move?
We were on the house playing PS
You came through mean asset  in a mean  dress.., you had a brother saying you a soul sister
I mean baby baby we should fcuk fcuk incest
But I didn't get the vibe you was on
If you didn't wanna come you should've just stayed home
How coud you have earphones on
Watching game of thrones on your cell phone
How could you even hear it mama
The music we were playing was louder than marijuana
How could you even hear it mama
The music we were playing was louder than marijuana
[Chorus]


[VERSE 3]

Is this what you want at all?
Do you wanna talk at all?
Once upon a time you were always calling
Now, you don't even talk at all
A few years ago when you had me up all night baby girl we were power tripping
But now
You got me up all night thinking to myself tryna comprehend how we're living
This ain't a game you ain't gotta play it
Like a fake black T-shirt it's getting faded
To be honest I miss you I dunno if you miss me
How would I know when you never say it
And you never show it
You know it's not good
I used to say even if It goes bad It's all good
But it's a different ball game when it goes from everything you ever wanted to everything that's bad for you, yup! True!!!
I was living a lie
It's for me to say and you to know
For a while I was trapped in denial
But the truth sets you free, you're free to go",2996963,en,en,en

I GET UP ! & praise God for another day of life
I'm dreaming about success though these times are getting tight
I want to get away till I'm completely out of sight
Then comeback with a plaque & a deal on the mic
But I can't seem to step away from this shit
Cause a nigga gotta grind since this recession shit hit
& my depression through these sessions got me feinding a hit
Of that bomb on my moms I was dying to quit
But I ARISE ! I know to you haters it's a suprise
But I'm destine for success & you can see it in my eyes
You can hear it in my vocs when I flow though the door
You can tell that boy shine like a gold dayton spoke
OH NO ! man you better let these niggas know
That I'm climbing from the top like I'm at the bottom of a rope
Breaking up another swish & let my lungs fill up with smoke
Break the back up off a bitch & after that I gotta go, I GOTTA GO !
Cause bitch, I need to stack up this dough
Gotta get my mama out of here & my auntie off of coke
Gotta get my papa in the hills with all the liquor he wants
I got some cousins riding shotty with they hand on they pumps
LIKE WHAT ? nigga if you got beef
Will have you chilling with the angels like bosley
& if you looking for me man you know where I be
Inside a bitch going deep just like a Ivy
Try me I'll have your head on a side street
With your whole shit cracked like a palla seed
Now, Follow me & I can show you where them dollars be
You see that bitch ? yea i bet she gone swallow me
Fuck what you gotta do it's what you gotta be
Catch me blowing smoke in the sweet of the odyssey

When the Sun Comes,rap,Beneficence,2016,3,"{""Masta Ace""}","Chorus-When the sun comes, you know the time and exactly where we coming from, uh, When the sun comes you know the time and exactly where we coming from, uh

When the sun comes reflect, observe the effects
Bet it shine on the most hood blood and crip sets. Perform at it’s peak. Shine the rays on producers til they format a beat. Same sun on the backs of slaves who chosе to speak. Today the brighter sun makеs wise words unique. Bring the heat to a chill, degrees that make Weezy respect Emmitt Till. Bring the brighter idea. Hope the sun finds it’s way to the face of Mumia. Make it much more clearer, Still blinding when reflected directly in the mirror. To my dudes
That fell down see ya’ll gone climb again. In the darkest nights the sun shall rise again. Set up solar power to them third world countries.  Hope the sun puts flames to the snitches and flunkies
The hottest star formed from a molecular cloud. The sun beamed on a boy who made his momma so proud.  When the curtains close on this life take a bow.  The sun waits for no man that’s why the time is right now. Natural Phenomenon make the world say wow

Chorus- Open your mind let in the bright sunshine, we travel the road wise til we reach our prime, perfect blend of perfection, it shows the reflection, decisions is yours so make the right selection, In these streets we don’t speak so to each is own, We still inherit the light like the Melanite stone, You know we walk wit the torch lit, Strength make em forfeit, back peddling cautious, Bringing heat like August

Masta Ace-
My man’s calling me sun cause I shine like one, and I rise before your eyes and blind like one, there’s a whole lotta stars sitting up in VIP trying to be like me, but I’m like none. I be the dawn of a new day illustrious, trust me it’s bound to take the cake like a souffle. competiton get heated when I’m in the kitchen and go off top of the head like a Toupe’, In these sun rays, you can sun bath, Brownsville streets where my mom had her son raised, Most Sundays in the hotter months, I would’ve clipped the marks of a lotta chumps, and rise above em all, forget ya’ll regional plans, got a whole legion of fans and I love em all, and when it goes down imma rise again, and bring hope to your lives again, The sun

Chorus- Open your mind let in the bright sunshine, we travel the road wise til we reach our prime, perfect blend of perfection, it shows the reflection, decisions is yours so make the right selection, In these streets we don’t speak so to each is own, We still inherit the light like the melanite stone, You know we walk wit the torch lit, Strength make em forfeit, back peddling cautious, Bringing heat like August

Roy Ayers knew the time that’s why everybody loves the sunshine, divine for my people on the grind. My dudes let’s celebrate coming straight out the gate who faced 6 to 8 in that federal state. Hope the rays illuminate on the grave of Big L, and every last fallen soldier who repped the game well. We spin on a carousel watching are bills swell, speeding through life endangered Dama Gazelle. We calmly excel and cash out like Chappelle. Open stores like Patels clear vision like Cazels. Sharper than lapels see In a nutshell those rumors we dispel and haters we repel. Still the place where we dwell and sometimes rebel. Ride the waves and sail with a lady named Lavelle.  Hit the gas propel, long way from the shrapnel. When the sun comes I bid problems farewell

Chorus- Open your mind let in the bright sunshine, we travel the road wise til we reach our prime, perfect blend of perfection, it shows the reflection, decisions is yours so make the right selection, In these streets we don’t speak so to each is own, We still inherit the light like the Melanite stone, You know we walk wit the torch lit, Strength make em forfeit, back peddling cautious, Bringing heat like August",7879558,en,en,en

We go to church and we pray we need the answers as well
I don’t need a drum beat but the rhythm just helps
Put my mother fucking thoughts out express myself
Get this pain off my chest can I end myself
If I neck myself will I be deemed in hell
Will I be deemed as insane the boy that never got help
If you paid attention you would see he didn’t need help
Maybe the kid was too busy helping everyone else
Where was his people when needed to ask him how he felt
And now i's too late caught up living in a fake world
Where the rich get richer and the poor pour liquor
New disease on the rise but only poor get sicker
Media feeding lies make us point that finger
Ego driving with no seat belt soon to crash
History repeats itself just take a look at the past
Another kid dead suicide my ass

This is me yelling out you can’t ignore the facts
We done pushed him off the cliff another stat on a graph

Wondering what had happened to her man

With the kind of love no human heart can fake
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake

Who shudders as he passes my way
His eyes can bring me to my knees
My father beats me when he sees
‘Merope,’ he says, ‘how can you look
At a man who’s not like you?
Go clean the kitchen, you little rat
This man’s blood isn’t true’

But what is blood when I only see beauty?
When’s a Muggle ever been so pure?
Oh, father, brother, there is no other
He’s the only one, I’m sure

One day when I am all alone
I coax thе man inside my home
I offer him a tasty drink
And bеfore he even has time to think
He takes my hand, and we’re in love
My eyes fill with tears of joy
We’re married within a year
Like magic, I’ve gotten the boy
And what’s a potion when I only see beauty?
And who cares if our love isn’t pure?
I’ve finally got the one that I want
And we’ll be happy for sure, for sure

But I can’t take it any more
The wonder’s flowing in my head
For I cannot solve the mystery
Of the Riddle lying next to me
Too bad he doesn’t really love me
No, he’s just under a spell
I can’t live with the guilt, so I’ll just let him go
And myself as well

I stumble to a battered door
I scream, collapse; I’m on the floor
I cannot breathe, but I’m a mum
I touch my child and name him Tom

And what is death when new life is created?
And Tom Marvolo looks just like him
He will redeem my honor
And when he finds his father
Tell him I’m sorry (I’m sorry)
Forgive me (Forgive me)

Filed me like a lawsuit

Treat the young with no accountability
Shoot me down

In the lies of our eyes when we touch

As the night skies are watching us stand
Here in the filth and the lack
Of our pathetic existence

Searching in vain in the depths of my eyes
Some demons to slay and stay alive
We take the pain alone
Try to take it away from our heads

Remember just how long it took
For me to see

To live without you

I'm gonna break this into
A million pieces
Yeah I believed it was true
And now I'm holding onto
A thousand reasons

Yeah I'm going far away
I am finding a way
To live without you
Yes I'm leaving here today
And tomorrow is another day
Without you
And if I never say good-bye
I'm only waiting for you to even
Blink an eye
‘Cause when this rain starts coming down
Well I'll be miles and miles and mile and miles
From this town

Yeah I'm going far away
I am finding a way
To live without you
Yeah I'm leaving here today
And tomorrow is another day
Without you, without you

First Impressions,rock,The Publics,2019,115,{},"[Verse 1]

Introductions don't happen when you walk in the room
Cause by then people all have first impressions on you
From what they've heard
From what their friends have said
They're all opinionated
Thoughts locked in their head
You move in and they're all already on to you
Your awkward smile reassures the boys you've seen them move
Their huddle forms
Their game plans set
The pack become competitors and you're the one they're out to get

[Verse 2]

One by one you write them off cause you have found their floors
That ones a smack-head and the other's scared of the dance floor
Theres that one who sits waiting for his chance
When you've had a couple glasses (Just wait till the hour passes)
Intoxicated your thought process it gets messed up
Next boy's in play seems like he will be the lucky one
Effortlessly he moves over and takes your hand
Finds you a place to talk
Somewhere you can still hear the band
[Bridge]

He says
(What's your name then?)
That you know
(Heard you'll do this)
Well I won't
Is that what you think of me?
(Thought you did this)
Well I didn't
(Are you loaded?)
Nah Im skint
But if i had a pound for every-time I've heard this
I'd give you fifty quid and not a kiss

Introductions don't happen when you walk in the room

From church and kings I was betrayed
Eye to eye with hagmans blade

I fight til my heart will be free

My last words are revolution

Guilty they called me, strangled by hanging
Released the cord, as I was still alive
Eviscerated and beheaded
Haunting minutes before I've to die

Fulfill our manifest destiny
And annex the land the Mexicans command

Made sure the tariffs fell
And made the English sell the Oregon territory

Ask for love if it just rolls by?""

But you're older and wiser
So I just keep hoping the truth will come out

Please tell me five things that made you stay
Then tell me five of your greatest mistakes
I'm feeling doubtful
And I need new faith
That only a mother could give me
That only a daughter could take

At first you lie
It's become second nature
To protect me from horrible truths that would make you seem
Weak and afraid
But I know about the sacrifice you've made
You say ""Darling it's late
My mind's become useless
I'm old and I'm tired, and all of this talking
Is beyond most
You'll learn for yourself how life goes""

I'll give you one scene I hold to this day
Your father held my hand
He said, ""I know we're not perfect, but I love you
I love you anyway
Yeah, I love you
I love you anyway, yeah""

She  took off in a ‘65 Mustang

She  drove on out to the east side

I  ran a red light to get closer
I kept smellin’ gasoline
And two blocks down from City Hall

I  swung round on a quarter
I musta clipped a yellow cab
I could hear someone shoutin’ behind me
They sure thought I was mad

I’m not given to dreamin’
But this was like a special day
The city slipped behind us
What I was doin’ I just couldn’t say
Well, I knew I was losing pressure
When I got on the Interstate
I couldn’t afford to get too far behind
So I floored the gas, ‘cause I could not wait

She was headin’ for Amarillo
The Mustang was throwin’ up spray
Out of the night came an eighteen wheeler
And she didn’t get out of the way

Well, the car went over the Oakie Bridge
I could hear the motor whine
Lit up the sky like the 4th of July
And the Big Mac followed, a wheel at a time

I was still staring into the distance
Long after the fire trucks had gone
She never knew I was watchin’
And I never knew what was wrong

I can’t understand what’d made her
Take off in the night that way
Maybe a secret rendezvous
Or somethin’ else, I just couldn’t say

The Buick was dead by the roadside
Musta driven it into the ground
I walked back, took an hour or so
Couldn’t figure what was goin’ down
The sun was above the horizon
When I let myself in through the door
She was standing with her back to me
And the white tuxedo was on the floor

Seems she was thrown in the river
Looks like she got away

Plays about my tongue and eases

Raise flares to the dwellings of equivocation
May impermanence temper your suffering

And your pointed fear of a textbook senescence
Parceling out monotonies bent and arthritic
Waning baleful in the attics of decline

Shaped by the efforts of coercion
Bound helpless by the tethers of duress
Gilded with lack to frame your body

Seconds birthing minutes became decades
Dusks new and unfamiliar sprang upon us

Taming the Dragon,rock,Brad Mehldau and Mark Guiliana,2014,2348,{},"[Narration by Brad Melhdau]
Verse 1:
I had this trippy dream were this cat was driving me around in an old convertible the whole time around L.A. Later on it turned into a VW van and near the end it was more like this spaceship kind of thing, and were high up looking over the road, but the front console was shaped like a van and it still had the convertible top. The guy who was driving me around was an older dude - an old hipster with a scratchy voice kind of like Joe Walsh sings, but he kind of had some of that vibe and energy of Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider. Yeah, like if you can imagine a cross between Joe Walsh and Dennis Hopper - that's the dude who was driving me

Verse 2:
We were heading due north on the PCH, coming up to the big stoplight where Sunset Boulevard ends, and were gonna head out past there toward Malibu, maybe circle up through Topanga Canyon and come back through the valley. The light was beautiful in the dream, with all that nice washed-out orange from the pollution. So I had this happy feeling in my stomach but also like this scared feeling like something gonna happen but I didn't know what. Anyhow, as we approaching the light at Sunset, all of a sudden this cat in a sports car came out of nowhere and just cut us off. My man slammed on the brakes and narrowly averted a mash-up. It got my blood boiling, but you know, I wasn't the one driving

Verse 3:
Yeah, so wouldn't you know it, we pulled right up behind that motherfucker at the light and there he was glaring at us through his rear view; he was all like 'Yeah that's right I cut you off, what are you going to do about it?'. So I said to Joe Walsh-slash-Dennis Hopper - I'll just call him Joe now - so I said to Joe ''Man, aren't you gonna say some shit to that douchebag?''. I was all puffed up and pissed off, but I was sitting in the passenger seat. So Joe was quiet and looked straight ahead and said ''You know, man, the only way I'm gonna put some shit out there like that is if I'm ready to dance with that cat. You know what I mean? 'All you've got are your actions, man - and don't forget, your words are you actions too. You put something out there, there's consequences, you know? You wanna dance with that dude?""

Verse 4:
You know, now I realize that Joe was driving me around everywhere and it's like I wasn't even thanking him. I realize that at first I thought he was kind of wild and a bad influence on me, like from my party days, but actually the whole time he kind of like driving me around and taking care of me, watching my back, like the crazy dude in the small car, like how he actually handled that while thing real noble and didn't get all ruffled. He was talking me down from something. I only realized that when I woke up

Verse 5:
It's funny how sometimes with dreams you don't realize who's your friend until after you wake up. Then when you wake up you get this clarity and you see that maybe all these different people were you in the dream and that they're there to lead you to either good or trouble. And the person who's actually acting as you in the dream is kind of like this blind idiot who's just barreling through the whole dream, like I was, trying to be all tough and shit, telling old Joe to go start something with that punk in the sports car

Yeah, but maybe like that crazy dude in the other car was me as well - all those people are just composite of my own shit, all the different parts of me - like you've got this one part of you that watches out for you and keeps you steady, you've got this other part that's raging and full of anger, and those two are vying for your attention, like old Joe and the crazy dude in the dream, and then there's just you and you're listening to both of those voices. But they're all a part of you
You know, I think of it like taming a dragon. The dragon is the crazy dude and if you don't watch out he'll bite your ass hard. So you need old Joe there to set you straight. But Joe knows about the dragon, because Joe and the dragon are a part of you. So don't try to kill the dragon - you know, the dragon's where you get all that voodoo shit from, that's where you get your power from. You don't want to snuff him out, you wanna tame him, you wanna actually make friends with him and harness his power so you can use it...",2888372,en,en,en

Men younger than I am
Whose fathers I would have refused
With dogs that guarded my flock
What use was the power of their hands
Their vigor has perished
They are worn out from want and hunger
They gnaw at the parched ground
That was ruined and desolated
They gather preserves from the bushes
Consuming the root of diseased trees
Exiled from their heritage
Ostracized like thiefs

Dwelling on creviced cliffs
In holes in the ground
From thickets they cry out
Intetwined amongst thorns
Sons of the senseless
Cast far away
Mocking hymns
I've become an object of scorn
They detest me
Far away from me they stand
With spit they cover my face
The sun has disarmed me and made me low
There is no mercy in my presence
Barriers of destruction are in my path
There's no one to stop them
Did someone breach the wall
Terror overwhelms me
My dignity is driven away like the wind
My life recedes from me
Held by days of affliction
The gnawing pain never stops
The collar of my garment chokes me
Reduced to dust and ashes
I cry for help but there is no answer
All have turned against me
Tossed about in the storm
Have I not wept for others during hard times
Have I not grieved
I hoped for good but badness came
The churning did not stop

Drink when i don't call
Go out when your feed up

Can you tell me what I did
Can you please not shut me out
Please don’t leave me all alone
Tell me what this is about
I don’t know what I did
We were fine all along
Mmm you made me so weak now I struggle to stay strong
When did all this get f***ed up
Tell me where did we go wrong
Now there’s nobody to turn to
All I have is this song

You’re gone

I was focused on the prize
Never noticed all the lies, now it’s all gone
It’s funny if I had a new chance I’d probably play the same song
Still act like there never was a thing wrong
It’s okay, be okay, girl I’ll still let you have it your way
Wrote a whole tape ‘bout the things I’ll say
Before it all falls down
I guess I’ll throw it all away
Was it worth it
Probably not
Better than before because you’re perfect
All them other guys don’t even deserve it

Told you I was the answer and you still circled B

But really I’m shitless, I’m scared
Pardon my language, Forgive me
I pray you ain’t mad
Father I swear I’ll repent
But you know I’m probably gon’ do it again
Father Forgive
Oh Father forgive me for you know that I have sinned
You know me better than any man
I didn’t know where to go but I heard momma say I should pray when I need a hand

I’m outa practice
So I donna where to begin
Father Forgive me
Oh Father Forgive me for you know that I
That I, have sinned

Father Forgive me
Me for you know that I
That I, have sinned



It’s been a minute, I know I’m innocent
Lord it just feels like my walls are just closing in
I feel the pressure, sometimes I can barely breathe
They say that prayer, the bridge to a thousand dreams
Please meet me halfway
Coz this journey is cutting deep
I need your guidance, I need your reach
See
I know you give sight to the blind
You so poetic
That means if I’m lost then I’ll find
You and the Heavens’
The catch is I have to believe
Father and You The Devine
Man you turned water wine
That means you’ll turn all my sorrows to joy and I’ll finally find

I love my name. My mother thought of that name. The story that she tells us is that she was walking down Belmont Avenue and it was the middle of the day she was by herself and she was pregnant with me. And she said that she just heard a voice in her head and it was just, I guess, me talking before I was born and telling her what my name was. So, sometimes I like to think I named myself (*Laughter*) is the name that I signaled to her that was what my name already was",3202270,en,en,en

The Carpenters Son,misc,Sara Teasdale,2013,3,{},"THE summer dawn came over-soon,
The earth was like hot iron at noon
            In Nazareth;
There fell no rain to ease the heat,
And dusk drew on with tired feet
            And stifled breath.

The shop was low and hot and square,
And fresh-cut wood made sharp the air,
            While all day long
The saw went tearing thru the oak
That moaned as tho' the tree's heart broke
            Beneath its wrong.

The narrow street was full of cries,
Of bickering and snarling lies
            In many keys—
The tongues of Egypt and of Rome
And lands beyond the shifting foam
            Of windy seas.
Sometimes a ruler riding fast
Scattered the dark crowds as he passed,
            And drove them close
In doorways, drawing broken breath
Lest they be trampled to their death
            Where the dust rose.

There in the gathering night and noise
A group of Galilean boys
            Crowding to see
Gray Joseph toiling with his son,
Saw Jesus, when the task was done,
            Turn wearily.

He passed them by with hurried tread
Silently, nor raised his head,
            He who looked up
Drinking all beauty from his birth
Out of the heaven and the earth
            As from a cup.

And Mary, who was growing old,
Knew that the pottage would be cold
            When he returned;
He hungered only for the night,
And westward, bending sharp and bright,
            The thin moon burned.
He reached the open western gate
Where whining halt and leper wait,
            And came at last
To the blue desert, where the deep
Great seas of twilight lay asleep,
            Windless and vast.

With shining eyes the stars awoke,
The dew lay heavy on his cloak,
            The world was dim;
And in the stillness he could hear
His secret thoughts draw very near
            And call to him.

Faint voices lifted shrill with pain
And multitudinous as rain;
From all the lands
And all the villages thereof
Men crying for the gift of love
            With outstretched hands.

Voices that called with ceaseless crying,
The broken and the blind, the dying,
             And those grown dumb
Beneath oppression, and he heard
Upon their lips a single word,
            ""Come!""
Their cries engulfed him like the night,
The moon put out her placid light
            And black and low
Nearer the heavy thunder drew,
Hushing the voices . . . yet he knew
            That he would go.

A quick-spun thread of lightning burns,
And for a flash the day returns—
            He only hears
Joseph, an old man bent and white
Toiling alone from morn till night
            Thru all the years.

Swift clouds make all the heavens blind,
A storm is running on the wind—
             He only sees
How Mary will stretch out her hands
Sobbing, who never understands
            Voices like these.",171962,en,en,en

With my Bible under my arm
'Till I was gray and old;
Unwedded, alone in the world,
Finding brothers and sisters in the congregation,
And children in the church.
I know they laughed and thought me queer.
I knew of the eagle souls that flew high in the sunlight,
Above the spire of the church, and laughed at the church,
Disdaining me, not seeing me.
But if the high air was sweet to them, sweet was the church to me.

Democratized!",171924,en,en,en
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,misc,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,2013,59,{},"President Hoover, Mr Chief Justice, my friends: this is a day of national consecration. And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the presidency, I will address them with a candour and a decision which the present situation of our people impels.

This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigour has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.

In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunk to fantastic levels: taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.

And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.

Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

True, they have tried. But their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.

Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.

Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves, to our fellow men.

Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honour, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, and on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live.

Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation is asking for action, and action now.

Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing great, greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganise the use of our great natural resources.
Hand in hand with that we must frankly recognise the overbalance of population in our industrial centres and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavour to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.

Yes, the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products, and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the federal, the state, and the local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities that have a definitely public character.

There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped by merely talking about it.

We must act. We must act quickly. And finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work, we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order. There must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments. There must be an end to speculation with other people's money. And there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.

These, my friends, are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfilment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the 48 States.

Through this programme of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time, and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favour, as a practical policy, the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment; but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.

The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not nationally - narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States of America - a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that recovery will endure.

In the field of world policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbour: the neighbour who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others; the neighbour who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbours.

If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realise, as we have never realised before, our interdependence on each other; that we can not merely take, but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress can be made, no leadership becomes effective.

We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good. This, I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us, bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife. With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.

Action in this image, action to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our constitution is so simple, so practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has ever seen.

It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations. And it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly equal, wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.

I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.
But, in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis - broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.

For the trust reposed in me, I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.

We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded, a permanent national life.

We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.

In this dedication - in this dedication of a nation, we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.",116480,en,en,en
Bruise,misc,Levi Todd,2016,344,{},"The other month, I gave myself a black eye...
While trying to do a  somersault.
I walked around looking like some fight club casting call wannabe, and when people lifted their eyebrows bloodthirsty for a story I told them,
“I gave myself a black eye while trying to do a  somersault,“
And then,
“Yeah, that is really what happened.”

And each time, every person responded with
“You should just make up a cool bar fight story.”
And each time, I wanted to tell them,
“You’re right,”
“It sounds so much better to say I downed enough shots to gloss over my better sense, enough, to morph a passing glance of another man into a death threat, enough, to lay him across the pavement with his blood painting my knuckles, or better yet maybe i’m the one on the pavement,  I guess it doesn’t really matter unless someone’s teeth are in the gutter.”

But that’s not what happened.

I accidentally gave myself a black eye,
and I’m not feeling insecure enough about my manhood to start lying about how manly I can be.
But if you want a story,
here’s a metaphor.

I was somersaulting, head spinning through expectations of manhood and came out the other side with a black eye.
I actually got the shiner from trying to evade masculine meteorites under the guides of dodgeballs in gym class, missing most of them but still hearing the catcall whistle fly past my ear.
I didn’t get the shiner from having a fun time,
no,
I got it from boxing, from stepping into the ring the day I was born with a crowd already formed.
Just waiting for me to throw my first punch.

I actually got payback for every guy trying to compensate for something, for trying to call me a bitch, a pussy, a faggot, a queer, or any other name implying that the worst thing for me to be is womanly, or that to love another man isn’t to be one.

And yeah, maybe I’m making too big a deal about this.
Maybe I’m making this a gender thing but so are we.
For telling our boys to man up when they start to cry
So are we, for saying that “boys will be boys” when they make someone else cry
So are we, for telling our girls that “if a boy hits you, it probably means he likes you.”
When my mother was a girl she was thrown into a rose bush from her bicycle when a boy pushed her,
her mother spent hours tweezing the thorns out of her back
So don’t tell me,
That that boy had a crush on my mom.
Don’t tell me, that this violence has a name anything other than what it is
Don’t tell me, that “boys will be boys”
When really, boys will be whatever we teach them they should be.
They’ll do whatever it takes to prove they’re a man, like hitting the gym, hitting another shot, hitting a home run, hitting on girls, hitting girls, hitting guys, hitting anything that lets them channel  the aggression they’ve been told is normal for them,
so no.

I didn’t get a black eye from hitting someone.
There’s no cool bar fight story to use, to validate the violence I’ve been told I should wear across my shoulders like a victory flag.

There’s no real winner in the real story.
And I guess,
that’s kind of the point.",4012161,en,en,en

The Little Dell,misc,William Allingham,2013,4,{},"Doleful was the land,
Dull on, every side,
Neither soft n'or grand,
Barren, bleak, and wide;
Nothing look'd with love;
All was dingy brown;
The very skies above
Seem'd to sulk and frown.

Plodding sick and sad,
Weary day on day;
Searching, never glad,
Many a miry way;
Poor existence lagg'd
In this barren place;
While the seasons dragg'd
Slowly o'er its face.

Spring, to sky and ground,
Came before I guess'd;
Then one day I found
A valley, like a nest!
Guarded with a spell
Sure it must have been,
This little fairy dell
Which I had never seen.
Open to the blue,
Green banks hemm'd it round
A rillet wander'd through
With a tinkling sound;
Briars among the rocks
Tangled arbours made;
Primroses in flocks
Grew beneath their shade.

Merry birds a few,
Creatures wildly tame,
Perch'd and sung and flew;
Timid field-mice came;
Beetles in the moss
Journey'd here and there;
Butterflies across
Danced through sunlit air.

There I often read,
Sung alone, or dream'd;
Blossoms overhead,
Where the west wind stream'd;
Small horizon-line,
Smoothly lifted up,
Held this world of mine
In a grassy cup.
The barren land to-day
Hears my last adieu:
Not an hour I stay;
Earth is wide and new.
Yet, farewell, farewell!
May the sun and show'rs
Bless that Little Dell
Of safe and tranquil hours!",226675,en,en,en
The Bacchae Scene III  Interlude III,misc,Euripides,2013,1615,{},"[The soldiers move in to round up the chorus of Bacchae.  As they do so, the ground begins to shake, thunder sounds, lightning flashes, and the entire palace starts to break apart]

DIONYSUS: [shouting from within the palace]
Io! Hear me, hear me as I call you.
Io! Bacchae!  Io Bacchae!

CHORUS: [a  confusion of different voices in the following speeches]
Who's that?  Who is it?  It's Dionysus' voice!
It's calling me.  But from what direction?

DIONYSUS: [From inside the palace] Io! Io! I'm calling out again—         [580]
the son of Semele, a child of Zeus!                                        720

CHORUS: Io! Io! Lord and master!
Come join our company,
Bromius, oh Bromius!

DIONYSUS: [From inside] Sacred lord of earthquakes, shake this ground.
[The earthquake tremors resume]

CHORUS VOICE 1: Ai!  Soon Pentheus' palace
will be shaken into rubble.
CHORUS VOICE 2: Dionysus is in the house—revere him.

CHORUS VOICE 3: We revere him, we revere him.                             [590]

CHORUS VOICE 4: You see those stone lintels on the pillars—
they're splitting up.  It's Bromius calling,                               730
shouting to us from inside the walls.

DIONYSUS: [from inside the palace]  Let fiery lightning strike right now—
burn Pentheus' palace—consume it all!

CHORUS VOICE 5: Look! Don't you see the fire—
there by the sacred tomb of Semele!
The flame left by that thunderbolt from Zeus,
when the lightning flash destroyed her,
all that time ago.  Oh Maenads—
throw your bodies on the ground, down, down,                             [600]
for our master, Zeus' son, moves now                                   740
against the palace—to demolish it.

[Enter Dionysus, bursting through the palace front doors, free of all chains, smiling and supremely confident.]

DIONYSUS: Ah, my barbarian Asian women,
Do you lie there on the ground prostrate with fear?
It seems you feel Dionysus' power,
as he rattles Pentheus' palace.
Get up now.  Be brave.  And stop your trembling.
CHORUS LEADER: How happy I am to see you—
Our greatest light in all the joyful dancing.
We felt alone and totally abandoned.

DIONYSUS: Did you feel despair when I was sent away,              750    [610]
cast down in Pentheus' gloomy dungeon?

CHORUS LEADER: How could I not? Who'll protect me
if you run into trouble?  But tell me,
how did you escape that ungodly man?

DIONYSUS: No trouble.  I saved myself with ease.

CHORUS LEADER: But didn't he bind up your hands up in chains?

DIONYSUS: In this business I was playing with him—
he thought he was tying me up, the fool!
He didn't even touch or handle me,
he was so busy feeding his desires.                                         760
In that stable where he went to tie me up,
he found a bull.  He threw the iron fetters
around its knees and hooves. As he did so,
he kept panting in his rage, dripping sweat                                   [620]
from his whole body—his teeth gnawed his lip.
I watched him, sitting quietly nearby.
After a while, Bacchus came and shook the place,
setting his mother Semele's tomb on fire.
Seeing that, Pentheus thought his palace
was burning down.  He ran round, here and there,                 770
yelling to his slaves to bring more water.
His servants set to work—and all for nothing!
Once I'd escaped, he ended all that work.
Seizing a dark sword, he rushed inside the house.
Then, it seems to me, but I'm guessing now,
Bromius set up out there in the courtyard                                      [630]
some phantom image.  Pentheus charged it,
slashing away at nothing but bright air,
thinking he was butchering me.  There's more—
Bacchus kept hurting him in still more ways.                         780
He knocked his house down, right to the ground,
all shattered, so Pentheus has witnessed
a bitter end to my imprisonment.
He's dropped his sword, worn out, exhausted,
a mere mortal daring to fight a god.
So now I've strolled out calmly to you,
leaving the house, ignoring Pentheus.
Wait!  It seems to me I hear marching feet—
no doubt he'll come out front here soon enough.
What will he say, I wonder, after this?                                    790
Well, I'll deal with him quite gently,                                               [640]
even if he comes out breathing up a storm.
After all, a wise man ought to keep his temper.
[Pentheus comes hurriedly out of the palace, accompanied by armed soldiers]

PENTHEUS: What's happening to me—total disaster!
The stranger's escaped, and we'd just chained him up.
[Seeing Dionysus]
Ah ha! Here is the man—right here.
What's going on?  How did you get out?
How come you're here, outside my palace?

DIONYSUS: Hold on.  Calm down.  Don't be so angry.

PENTHEUS: How did you escape your chains and get here?        800

DIONYSUS: Didn't I say someone would release me—
or did you miss that part?

PENTHEUS:                                  Who was it?                                     [650]
You're always explaining things in riddles.

DIONYSUS: It was the one who cultivates for men
the richly clustering vine.

PENTHEUS:                        Ah, this Dionysus.
Your words are a lovely insult to your god.

DIONYSUS: He came to Thebes with nothing but good things.

PENTHEUS: [To soldiers] Seal off all the towers on my orders—
all of them around the city.

DIONYSUS:                                          What for?
Surely a god can make it over any wall?                                810

PENTHEUS: You're so wise, except in all those things
in which you should be wise.

DIONYSUS:                                 I was born wise,
especially in matters where I need to be.
[Enter the Messenger, a cattle herder from the hills]

DIONYSUS: But first you'd better listen to this man,
hear what he has to say, for he's come here
from the mountains to report to you.
I'll still be here for you. I won't run off.

MESSENGER: Pentheus, ruler of this land of Thebes,                           [660]
I've just left Cithaeron, that mountain
where the sparkling snow never melts away.                         820

PENTHEUS: What this important news you've come with?

MESSENGER: I saw those women in their Bacchic revels,
those sacred screamers, all driven crazy,
the ones who run barefoot from their homes.
I came, my lord, to tell you and the city
the dreadful things they're doing, their actions
are beyond all wonder.  But, my lord,
first I wish to know if I should tell you,
openly report what's going on up there,
or whether I should hold my tongue.                                      830
Your mood changes so fast I get afraid—                                      [670]
your sharp spirit, your all-too-royal temper.

PENTHEUS: Speak on.  Whatever you have to report,
you'll get no punishment at all from me.
It's not right to vent one's anger on the just.
The more terrible the things you tell me
about those Bacchic women, the worse
I'll move against the one who taught them
all their devious tricks.

MESSENGER:                     The grazing cattle
were just moving into upland pastures,                                 840
at the hour the sun sends out its beams
to warm the earth.  Right then I saw them—
three groups of dancing women.  One of them                              [680]
Autonoe led. Your mother, Agave,
led the second group, and Ino led the third.
They were all asleep, bodies quite relaxed,
some leaning back on leafy boughs of pine,
others cradling heads on oak-leaf pillows,
resting on the ground—in all modesty.
They weren't as you described—all drunk on wine                850
or on the music of their flutes, hunting
for Aphrodite in the woods alone.
Once she heard my horned cattle lowing,
your mother stood up amid those Bacchae,
then called them to stir their limbs from sleep.
They rubbed refreshing sleep out of their eyes,                             [690]
and stood up straight there—a marvelous sight,
to see such an orderly arrangement,
women young and old and still unmarried girls.
First, they let their hair loose down their shoulders,              860
tied up the fawn skins (some had untied the knots
to loosen up the chords).  Then around those skins
they looped some snakes, who licked the women's cheeks.
Some held young gazelles or wild wolf cubs
and fed them on their own white milk, the ones                            [700]
who'd left behind at home a new-born child
whose breasts were still swollen full of milk.
They draped themselves with garlands from oak trees,
ivy and flowering yew.  Then one of them,
taking a thyrsus, struck a rock with it,                                   870
and water gushed out, fresh as dew.  Another,
using her thyrsus, scraped the ground. At once,
the god sent fountains of wine up from the spot.
All those who craved white milk to drink
just scratched the earth with their fingertips—
it came out in streams.  From their ivy wands                                [710]
thick sweet honey dripped.  Oh, if you'd been there,
if you'd seen this, you'd come with reverence
to that god whom you criticize so much.
Well, we cattle herders and shepherds met                            880
to discuss and argue with each other
about the astonishing things we'd seen.
And then a man who'd been in town a bit
and had a way with words said to us all,
""You men who live in the holy regions
of these mountains, how'd you like to hunt down
Pentheus' mother, Agave—take her                                               [720]
away from these Bacchic celebrations,
do the king a favour?""  To all of us
he seemed to make good sense.  So we set up                       890
an ambush, hiding in the bushes,
lying down there.  At the appointed time,
the women started their Bacchic ritual,
brandishing the thyrsus and calling out
to the god they cry to, Bromius, Zeus' son.
The entire mountain and its wild animals
were, like them, in one Bacchic ecstasy.
As these women moved, they made all things dance.
Agave, by chance, was dancing close to me.
Leaving the ambush where I'd been concealed,                      900
I jumped out, hoping to grab hold of her.                                        [730]
But she screamed out, ""Oh, my quick hounds,
men are hunting us.  Come, follow me.
Come on, armed with that thyrsus in your hand.""
We ran off, and so escaped being torn apart.
But then those Bacchic women, all unarmed,
went at  the heifers browsing on the turf,
using  their bare hands.  You should have seen one
ripping a fat, young, lowing calf apart—
others tearing cows in pieces with their hands.                      910
You could've seen ribs and cloven hooves                                     [740]
tossed everywhere—some hung up in branches
dripping blood and gore.  And bulls, proud beasts till then,
with angry horns, collapsed there on the ground,
dragged down by the hands of a thousand girls.
Hides covering their bodies were stripped off
faster than you could wink your royal eye.
Then, like birds carried up by their own speed,
they rushed along the lower level ground,
beside Asopus' streams, that fertile land                                920
which yields its crops to Thebes.  Like fighting troops,                  [750]
they raided Hysiae and Erythrae,
below rocky Cithaeron, smashing
everything, snatching children from their homes.
Whatever they carried their shoulders,
even bronze or iron, never tumbled off
onto the dark earth, though nothing was tied down.
They carried fire in their hair, but those flames
never singed them.  Some of the villagers,
enraged at being plundered by the Bacchae,                          930
seized weapons.  The sight of what happened next,                       [760]
my lord, was dreadful.  For their pointed spears
did not draw blood.  But when those women
threw the thrysoi in their hands, they wounded them
and drove them back in flight.  The women did this
to men, but not without some god's assistance.
Then they went back to where they'd started from,
those fountains which the god had made for them.
They washed off the blood.  Snakes licked their cheeks,
cleansing their skin of every drop.  My lord,                           940
you must welcome this god into our city,
whoever he is.  He's a mighty god                                                  [770]
in many other ways.  The people say,
so I've heard, he gives to mortal human beings
that vine which puts an end to human grief.
Without wine, there's no more Aphrodite—
or any other pleasure left for men.

CHORUS LEADER: I'm afraid to talk freely before the king,
but nonetheless I'll speak—this Dionysus
is not inferior to any god.                                                        950

PENTHEUS: This Dionysian arrogance, like fire,
keeps flaring up close by—a great insult
to all the Greeks.  We must not hesitate.
[To one of his armed attendants]
Go to the Electra Gates.  Call out the troops,                               [780]
the heavy infantry, all fast cavalry.
Tell them to muster, along with all those
who carry shields—all the archers, too,
the men who pull the bowstring back by hand.
We'll march out against these Bacchae.
In this whole business we will lose control,                            960
if we have to put up with what we've suffered
from these women.

DIONYSUS:                  You've heard what I had to say,
Pentheus, but still you’re not convinced.
Though I'm suffering badly at your hands,
I say you shouldn't go to war against a god.
You should stay calm.  Bromius will not let you                            [790]
move his Bacchae from their mountains.

PENTHEUS: Don't preach to me!  You've got out of prison—
enjoy that fact.  Or shall I punish you some more?

DIONYSUS: I'd sooner make an offering to that god                    970
than in some angry fit kick at his whip—
a mortal going to battle with a god.

PENTHEUS: I'll sacrifice all right—with a slaughter
of those women, just as they deserve—
in the forests on Cithaeron.

DIONYSUS:                                                  You'll all run.
What a disgrace! To turn your bronze shields round,
fleeing the thyrsoi of those Bacchic women!

PENTHEUS: [turning to one of his armed attendants, as if to go]
It's useless trying to argue with this stranger—                              [800]
whatever he does or suffers, he won't shut up.

DIONYSUS [calling Pentheus back]
My lord! There's still a chance to end this calmly.                 980

PENTHEUS: By doing what?  Should I become a slave
to my own slaves?

DIONYSUS:                   I'll bring the women here—
without the use of any weapons.

PENTHEUS:                                      I don't think so.
You're setting me up for your tricks again.

DIONYSUS:  What sort of trick, if I want to save you
in my own way?

PENTHEUS:                You've made some arrangement,
you and your god, so you can always dance
your Bacchanalian orgies.

DIONYSUS:                          Yes, that's true.
I have made some arrangement with the god.

PENTHEUS: [to one of his armed servants]
You there, bring me my weapons.
[to Dionysus]                                          And you,                   990
No more talk!  Keep quiet!

DIONYSUS:                                   Just a minute!                                [810]
[moving up to Pentheus]
How'd you like to gaze upon those women out there,
sitting together in the mountains?

PENTHEUS:                                        I'd like that.
Yes, for that I'd pay in gold—and pay a lot.

DIONYSUS: Why is that?  Why do you desire it so much?

PENTHEUS: I'd be sorry to see the women drunk.

DIONYSUS: Would you derive pleasure from looking on,
viewing something you find painful?

PENTHEUS:                                             Yes, I would—
if I were sitting in the trees in silence.

DIONYSUS:  But even if you go there secretly,                           1000
they'll track you down.

PENTHEUS:                           You're right.
I'll go there openly.

DIONYSUS:                           So you're prepared,
are you, to make the trip?  Shall I lead you there?

PENTHEUS: Let's go, and with all speed.  I've got time.                      [820]

DIONYSUS: In that case, you must clothe your body
in a dress—one made of eastern linen.

PENTHEUS: What! I'm not going up there as a man?
I've got to change myself into a woman?

DIONYSUS: If they see you as a man, they'll kill you.

PENTHEUS: Right again. You always have the answer.               1010

DIONYSUS: Dionysus taught me all these things.

PENTHEUS: How can I best follow your suggestion?

DIONYSUS: I'll go inside your house and dress you up.

PENTHEUS: What? Dress up in a female outfit?
I can't do that—I'd be ashamed to.

DIONYSUS: You're still keen to see the Maenads, aren't you?

PENTHEUS: What sort of clothing do you recommend?
How should I cover up my body?                                                   [830]

DIONYSUS: I'll fix up a long hair piece for your head.

PENTHEUS: All right. What's the next piece of my outfit?           1020

DIONYSUS: A dress down to your feet—then a headband,
to fit just here, around your forehead.

PENTHEUS: What else?  What other things will you provide?

DIONYSUS: A thyrsus to hold and a dappled fawn skin.

PENTHEUS: No.  I can't dress up in women's clothes!

DIONYSUS: But if you go fighting with these Bacchae,
you'll cause bloodshed.

PENTHEUS:                          Yes, that's true.
So first, we must go up and spy on them.

DIONYSUS: Hunt down evil by committing evil—
that sounds like a wise way to proceed.                                 1030

PENTHEUS: But how will I make it through the city
without the Thebans noticing me?                                                 [840]

DIONYSUS: We go by deserted streets.  I'll take you.

PENTHEUS: Well, anything's easier to accept
than being made a fool by Bacchic women.
Let's go into the house.  I'll think about what's best.

DIONYSUS: As you wish.  Whatever you do, I'm ready.

PENTHEUS: I think I'll go in now.  It's a choice
of going with weapons or taking your advice.

[Exit Pentheus into the palace.  Dionysus turns to face the chorus]

DIONYSUS: My women! that man's now entangled in our net.    1040
He'll go to those Bacchae, and there he'll die.
That will be his punishment.  Dionysus,
you're not far away.  Now it's up to you.
Punish him.  First, make sure he goes insane                                 [850]
with some crazed fantasy.  If his mind is strong,
he'll not agree to put on women's clothes.
But he'll do it, if you make him mad.
I want him made the laughing stock of Thebes,
while I lead him through the city, mincing
as he moves along in women's clothing,                                1050
after he made himself so terrifying
with all those earlier threats.   Now I'll be off,
to fit Pentheus into the costume
he'll wear when he goes down to Hades,
once he's butchered by his mother's hands.
He'll come to acknowledge Dionysus,
son of Zeus, born in full divinity,                                                  [860]
most fearful and yet most kind to men.
[Exit Dionysus]

CHORUS: Oh, when will I be dancing,
leaping barefoot through the night,                                       1060
flinging back my head in ecstasy,
in the clear, cold, dew-fresh air—
like a playful fawn
celebrating its green joy
across the meadows—
joy that it's escaped the fearful hunt—
as she runs beyond the hunters,
leaping past their woven nets—                                                     [870]
they call out to their hounds
to chase her with still more speed,                                        1070
but she strains every limb,
racing like a wind storm,
rejoicing by the river plain,
in places where no hunters lurk,
in the green living world
beneath the shady branches,
the foliage of the trees.
What is wisdom?  What is finer

over the heads of their enemies?                                                    [880]
Ah yes, what's good is always loved.
The power of the gods
is difficult to stir—
but it's a power we can count on.
It punishes all mortal men
who honour their own ruthless wills,
who, in their fits of madness,
fail to reverence the gods.
Gods track down every man                                                  1090
who scorns their worship,
using their cunning to conceal
the enduring steady pace of time.                                                   [890]
For there's no righteousness
in those who recognize or practice
what's beyond our customary laws.
The truth is easy to acknowledge:
whatever is divine is mighty,
whatever has been long-established law
is an eternal natural truth.                                                      1100
What is wisdom?  What is finer
than the rights men get from gods—
to hold their powerful hands
over the heads of their enemies?                                                    [900]
Ah yes, what's good is always loved.
Whoever has escaped a storm at sea
is a happy man in harbour,
whoever overcomes great hardship
is likewise another happy man.
Various men out-do each other                                              1110
in wealth, in power,
in all sorts of ways.
The hopes of countless men
are infinite in number.
Some make men rich;
some come to nothing.

I'm really happy to live here and was glad that we could do it in New York City. And, uh, I’m not sure how you all got here tonight, um... but I did wanna say this, I've never been, uh, killed by hit men, so I don't know what it’s like in the moments just before you're killed by hit men. But I bet it's not unlike when you're on the subway and you realize that a mariachi band is about to start playing. Just that brief moment where you're reading and you're like, ""Oh, a guitar player. Oh, another guitar player. Oh, an accordion player— oh no! This is the loudest thing in the world!""

Uh, I was really excited a lot of people, uh, showed up. They told me that it was a big theater and I thought that no one would come. So thank you for coming. I wanted to, like, take ads out in the paper. Like, be — you know, do something to a tot so I get in the New York Post or something. Uh, the New York Post is my favorite newspaper. I think it's great, I read it every day. I like reading the New York Post because reading the New York Post is like talking to someone who heard the news, and now they're trying to give you the gist. It’s like, you’d get the same amount of information if you grabbed someone on the street and you were like, ""What happened today?""
And they're like, ""There’s a perv in Queens!""
You'd be like, ""All right, thank you.""

Or rather, it's like someone read a better newspaper and now they're trying to text you everything they can remember. Doesn’t have to be right, just has to be short. I really do love the Post, I read it a lot and there's a hierarchy in the New York Post. Uh, different people that they like and different people that they don't like. Uh, and if you pay attention, you can start to identify some of the rankings that they have.

Um, the number one thing that you can be in the eyes of the New York Post is an angel. An angel is a child who has died. That is the best thing that you can be in the eyes of the New York Post. The less amount of time you live, the better… in the eyes of the Post. After that, under an angel is a hero. A hero is any man who does his job. You'll a lot of times see headlines that are like, ""Hero Tutor Teaches After School,"" and you're like ""Yeah..."" Down towards the bottom of the spectrum, there are pervs. Pervs touch tots, tots are angels who haven't died yet. There are no children in the eyes of the New York Post. You're either a tot or you're dead and you're an angel. I did leave one out, sorry. Above perv is a bozo. A bozo is any man who cheats on his wife. ""That guy's a bozo!""

I remember seeing a headline when Tiger Woods cheated on his wife and it says, ""Tiger says he's sorry, but Elin says 'Beat it, bozo!'"" No, she did not. She is from another country. And even if she was from this country, no one has said ""bozo"" in 1,000 years. Who was your source on that, New York Post? Some tiny old lady that chain smokes all day long?
They met her in a parking garage and they were like, ""Madge, give us the scoop! What did Elin say to Tiger?""

Patrols,misc,Rudyard Kipling,1915,20,{},"ON THE edge of the North Sea sits an Admiral in charge of a stretch of coast without lights or marks, along which the traffic moves much as usual. In front of him there is nothing but the east wind, the enemy and some few our ships. Behind him there are towns, with M.P.’s attached, who a little while ago didn’t see the reason for certain lighting orders. When a Zeppelin or two came they saw. Left and right of him are enormous docks, with vast crowded sheds, miles of stone-faced quay-edges, loaded with all manner of supplies and crowded with mixed shipping.

In this exalted world one met Staff-Captains, Staff-Commanders, Staff-Lieutenants, and Secretaries, with Paymasters so senior that they almost ranked with Admirals. There were Warrant Officers, too, who long ago gave up splashing about decks barefoot, and now check and issue stores to the ravenous, untruthful fleets. Said one of these, guarding a collection of desirable things, to a cross between a sick-bay attendant and a junior writer (but he was really an expert burglar), “No! And you can tell Mr. So-and-so, with my compliments, that the storekeeper’s gone away—right away—with the key of these stores in his pocket. Understand me? In his trousers pocket.”

He snorted at my next question.

“Do I know any destroyer-lootenants?” said he. “This coast’s rank with em! Destroyer-lootenants are born stealing. It’s a mercy they’s too busy to practice forgery, or I’d be in gaol. Engineer-Commanders? Engineer-Lootenants? They’re worse! . . . Look here! If my own mother was to come to me beggin’ brass screws for her own coffin, I’d—I’d think twice before I’d oblige the old lady. War’s war, I grant you that; but what I’ve got to contend with is crime.”

I referred to him a case of conscience in which every one concerned acted exactly as he should, and it nearly ended in murder. During a lengthy action, the working of a gun was hampered by some empty cartridge-cases which the lieutenant in charge made signs (no man could hear his neighbour speak just then) should be hove overboard. Upon which the gunner rushed forward and made other signs that they were “on charge,” and must be tallied and accounted for. He too, was trained in a strict school. Upon which the lieutenant, but that he was busy, would have slain the gunner for refusing orders in action. Afterwards he wanted him shot by court-martial. But every one was voiceless by then, and could only mouth and croak at each other, till somebody laughed, and the pedantic gunner was spared.

“Well, that’s what you might fairly call a naval crux,” said my friend among the stores. “The Lootenant was right. ’Mustn’t refuse orders in action. The Gunner was right. Empty cases are on charge. No one ought to chuck ’em away that way, but . . . Damn it, they were all of ’em right. It ought to ha’ been a marine. Then they could have killed him and preserved discipline at the same time.”",181284,en,en,en

Sat a Hampshire gentleman
Reading of a book.

And it told the plain
Story of the love between
Him and Jane.

Closed the book and answered:

I Want to Buy a Sloth With You,misc,Mo Lawrence,2015,593,{},"To the girl I have been looking for my entire life

Who I met yesterday

I want to buy a sloth with you

Even though I hate animals and I'm allergic to most household pets

I want to buy a sloth with you and care about it together

I want to buy a sloth with you and have it delivered via the post office

I want to drive home with you with the sloth in the backseat the same way dads drive to the hospital on their way to becoming dads

When moms are in the passenger seat going into labor on their way to becoming moms and the almost dads need to drive quickly, but carefully because something magical is going to happen and soon

I want to drive our sloth home like that

I want to speculate about the sloth with you before it arrives

I want to buy cute baby clothing and put it on the sloth when it comes
I look for forward to the way you say awe when the sloth is looking especially cute

I want to put the recording on my iPod so I can listen to when I do not have immediate access to the sloth and I want to remember how cute it was to you

I want to give the sloth a bubble bath with you

i want the sloth to have the meek expression on its face like the sad whale in that Rick Gervais comedy routine
when it is being penetrated by another whale
in the head

I wan to put all the bubbles around its head and mouth so it looks like an old man sloth with white hair and a white beard
So it looks like Santa Claus
After Santa Claus has had a lot of strokes
Kind of like The Grinch

I want to see the flash in your teeth as you laugh at the bubbles and the sloth because we will be being hilarious and I want to leave the bathroom for a moment to cry a little because I love you so much

I want to take the sloth to the movies
I want to take turns cuddling the sloth while we sit in the theatre watching rereleased movies like Trainspotting

I wan to speculate with you about watching our sloths eyes glaze over as we inject heroine into its wee little arms

I want to go back to your place after the movies and cuddle the sloth with you
I want to cuddle the sloth so hard that it has a panic attack
And we have to sing it lullabies like Baby Bunting and we have to bathe it in tea because www.primatestore.com says that sloths need to be bathed in tea to keep their skin and fur healthy and luscious
I want to bathe the sloth in tea with you

I want to buy a sloth with you, but mostly I just wan to love something with you
At the moment the best thing to love seems to be a sloth because it moves very slowly and it can never get away

Not like you, the girl I have been waiting for my entire life who I met yesterday, who left me today
Forever

Othello Thug Notes,misc,Nancy Reyes,2017,8,{},"Yo, what it is? This week haters gonna hate with Othello by William Shakespeare. One day soulja boy Iago kickin it with some fool named Roderigo when Roddy all like “Say Iago, why didn’t you tell me my girl Desdemona gone and married Othello? You know I’ve been tryin to hit that.” Iago say “Man f*** Othello. He gave a bump to dat scrub Cassio when it should be me climbin the ranks. Plus, I’m ‘spectin Othello been freakin on my woman. So fool best watch hisself cuz I’m comin fo him.” Revenge, sucka!

When word come to Dessy’s pappi, he get all up in Othello’s bidness and say “B**** did yo black-ass cast a spell on my daughter?” Othello like “Naw, blood. Ever since I told her bout all the s*** I’ve seen, she been ALL up on this.” Desdemona come in and sets daddy straight, and joins Othello and his homies to wreck that Turkish army that be rollin up on Cyprus. Up in Cyprus, Iago tricks Othello’s number 2 man Cassio into throwin back a lil too much drank. When Othello see C-dawg actin a fool, he gives him the boot. But Iago ain’t done messin. He tell Cassio “Say bruh, you should hit up Desdemona and axe if she can get Othello to smoothe things over.” But on the real, Iago playin dirty.

He tell Othello he best watch his b**** cuz she might be gettin down with Cassio. Othello ain’t buyin it at first, but when Iago plants one of Desdemona’s hankerchiefs in Cassio’s crib, brutha start wonderin. And Othello get all turnt up when he sees Cassio goin on about some woman he playin, cuz Iago make Othello think C-money talkin dirty bout Desdemona. After dat, Othello say “Man I’m gonna ICE that B****. Iago, if you my man, you’ll merc Cassio.” Not wanting to get his hands dirty, Iago convinces Roderigo to kill Cassio.

Even though s*** goes sideways, Iago still comes out on top. Roderigo can’t snitch since Iago put his ass six feet deep, and Cassio got a gnarly cut. Later, Othello rolls up on his woman, and straight chokes a b**** to death. When Iago’s biddy Emilia comes in, she like “WHAT THE F***, OTHELLO?” Othello tell her what’s up, and Emilia immediately calls Iago out, sayin he been lying his ass off. Iago like “b**** shut up!” And ENDS her. Man, what is this? The NFL? Knowin he got played, Othello stabs Iago and then ices himself before the po-po can put him away fo good.

Analysis

Ain’t no doubt dat fool Iago does some dirty s*** up in this play. But as bad as he is, you can’t deny that brutha do his own thang -- and with style.

Quote from play: “In following him I follow myself. / Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty, / But seeming so for my peculiar end. / For when my outward action doth demonstrate / The native act and figure of my heart / In compliment extern ‘tis not long after / But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve / For daws to peck at. I am not what I am” (Act 1, scene 1, lines 59-65).

Now if you bust open yo copy of Exodus and slide you b****-ass to 3:14, you’ll see dat fool God saying something similar: “I am what I am.” Like the big G-man, Iago pullin all the strings up in this heezy. But also, it’s like Iago dun flipped dem holy words words on they ass. Cuz Iago take good things, flips em around, and makes em evil. In fact, that’s how he stir up dat beef between Dezzy and Othello.

Quote from play: “And by how much she strives to do [Cassio] good / She shall undo her credit with the Moor. / So will I turn her virtue into pitch, / And out of her own goodness make the net / That shall enmesh them all” (Act 2, scene 3, lines 324-336).

Now y’all playas know Willy S never play it straight, and he’s always blurrin dat line between good and bad. When Roderigo start goin off bout virtue, Iago all like:

Quote from the play: “Virtue? A fig! ‘Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners” (Act 1, scene 3, lines 316-17).
Now what Iago really sayin is all hustlas are gardens, and the only one saying what you gotta plant is yo-self. Not God or anybody else. You make yourself what you want to be. Matter of fact, ol Willy got Iago tear down that holy jive all throughout this play. Fo example, when Iago tryin to convince Othello that his woman gettin freak nasty with Cassio, Othello like “Hell naw B. I got faith my Biddy love me.” But after showin him the handkerchief and lurin him to the convo between Cassio and Desdemona, Iago convince Othello “Man f*** faith. SEEING is believing, homeboy.” Too bad Othello don’t know what love is something you can’t see. But that’s okay playa cuz you can still show me love by hitting dat subscribe button. Catch y’all lata.

Another page so white,
Within that fateful Log of Life

Ah, could I, could I backward turn

How often would I blench and burn!
How often loathe to look!

What smeared as if with mud;

Some scarlet seem as blood.

Canadian Mike Smith holds the world record for the largest number counted to in one breath - 125. But the world record for the largest number ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham, Alabama. In order to set the record, Harper never left his apartment. He got regular sleep, but from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to bed at night, Harper did nothing but count. He streamed the entire process over the Internet and raised money for charity while doing it, but after three months of counting all day, every day, he finally reached the world record - 1 million. Now, a million might not sound like a lot, but think of this way. One thousand seconds is about 17 minutes, but a million seconds is more than 11 days. And a billion seconds, well, that's more than 31 years. There's no full video online of Harper counting all the way to a million, but you can watch John Harchick count all the way to 100,000, if you have 74 hours to spare. John also has some other channels. One involves more than 300 videos of himself eating carrots. Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself drinking water. Many of John's videos literally have no views.

They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get. A great way to find such videos is a website made by Jon van der Kruisen. This website auto-plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watched. John and Jeremy, as well as Mike, the one breath counter counted like this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. But that's not the only way to count. And it doesn't seem to be the one we're born with.

Additive counting is the one we're all familiar with, where each next step is just one added to the last. But what if we multiply it by a number instead? Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from ""arithmos"" meaning number and ""logos"" meaning ratio, proportion. On this scale, similar distances are similar proportions. One is a third of three and three is a third of nine. Four is a third of 12 and so on. Our brains perceive the world around us on a logarithmic scale. It's believed that almost all of our senses are multiplicative, not additive.

For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be. Two boomboxes playing at the same volume don't sound twice as loud as one. In order to make a sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boombox, you actually need ten times as many, so 10. And to double that loudness, you would need a hundred. And to double that loudness, you would need a thousand. Having an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into your brain is probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection and survival, because often proportion matters more than absolute value. For example, ""is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or two?"" is a very different question than ""are there ninety six lions about to attack us or ninety seven?"" Sure, in both cases I'm just talking about one extra lion, but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat. Adding one lion to 96, well, that's basically nothing.

Logarithmic thinking and feeling may explain why life seems to speed-up as we get older. It seems like I was a child for ever. And in college, in my early 20's, just whizzed by. And logarithmically, that makes sense, because each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all the other years I've already lived. When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is half your life. But when you turn 81, that last year that you've lived, well, that's just a tiny part of the other 80 that you know. Logarithmic thinking isn't always helpful, especially in scenarios where proportion doesn't logically matter but we, nonetheless, act like it does. One of my favorite examples is the psychophysics of price paradox. This is something almost all of us do.

Researchers found consistently that people are willing to put a lot of effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase, but they won't put much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2,000 dollar purchase. It's 5 dollars saved either way, but our natural obsession with proportion leads us astray. Take a look at these pictures. Can you tell how many objects are in each of them? You probably can. It's like really easy. You can tell if there are zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo without even needing to count. How are you doing that? Is it some sort of sixth sense? No.

Psychologists call it ""subitizing."" We can, intuitively, at a glance, determine whether there are about four or fewer objects in a photo. This has been part of human culture for a very long time and it may be the reason so many tally systems from all over the world all through history wind up having to do something different when counting the number five. When estimating or comparing amounts above 4, the brain uses what's known as an approximate number system. It's a psychological ability we have. It's about 15 percent accurate. It two amounts are at least 15 percent different, we can tell. So, for example, 100 objects and 115 or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200.

If you wanna test the accuracy of your approximate number system Panamath has a pretty good test. We often take linear additive counting for granted, but it's not granted to us. We aren't born with it. We are, however, born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate number system. Children younger than the age of three can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even if you spread the 4 coins out into a line that is physically bigger, longer than this line of 6. However, mysteriously, around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability and begin saying that this line of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age the physical world of objects, physical sizes, is more salient in their minds. But then, when they begin to learn linear counting, they reverse back and begin again correctly saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4, around the age of 4.

The smallest physical thing science could ever hope to observe is the Planck length. In order to look at anything smaller, you'd need to have so much energy concentrated in such a small area a black hole would form and you would lose whatever you were looking at. Okay, with that in mind, here's a question. What number is halfway in-between 1 and 9. 5 seems like the obvious answer. There are four numbers on either side of 5, it's halfway between, right? Well, if you ask this question of a young child or a member of a culture that doesn't teach a linear additive number line, their answer will be 3. You see, they are exhibiting the human mind's natural logarithmic tendency, because 3 in that sense makes sense. Three is three times larger than 1, and 9 is three times larger than 3. Three is in the middle, proportionately.

But what if we took that logarithmic number line and change the one to be the smallest thing we can observe, the Planck length, and the nine to be the largest thing we can observe, the observable universe. What would go in the middle? Well, as it turns out, we would. The number of Planck lengths you could stretch across a brain cell is equal to the number of your brain cells it would take to stretch all the way across the observable universe. sold So, welcome to the middle. And as always, thanks for watching. Hello again. The YouTube channel Field Day recently gave me an opportunity to explore Whittier, Alaska, one of the strangest places humans call home.

Annie Champion Biography,misc,League of Legends,2018,51,{},"Boram Darkwill’s last years on the throne were a time of great uncertainty for Noxus, and many with an aptitude for magic left the capital for the relative peace of more distant provinces. Gregori the Gray and his wife, a witch by the name of Amoline, preferred to demonstrate their Noxian strength by taming the borderlands, rather than partaking in the political intrigue of the noble houses.

The young couple claimed a piece of land beyond the Ironspike Mountains to the north, finishing their small home just before winter and the arrival of their first child. During their journey, other colonists’ tales of the great shadow bears that once roamed the territory had captivated Amoline—now heavily pregnant, she passed the time sitting near the fireplace, creating a toy version of the protective creatures. Just as she finished sewing the last button eye on the stuffed bear, the quickening of labor overcame her. Gregori remarked later that his daughter was eager to play with her new toy, for there, on an ember-warmed hearth, Amoline brought Annie into the world.

When Annie was still a toddler, she and her father took ill. As night fell, Annie began to burn with fever, and soon she was so hot, she could no longer be held in her mother’s arms. Amoline grew desperate, deciding at last to fetch icy water from the nearby river. The next morning Gregori awoke, weak and groggy from his sickness. In the crib, a now-healthy Annie played with her stuffed bear, Tibbers, but Amoline was gone.

Naïvely, Annie believed her mother would one day return. Gregori would often find the girl sitting in her mother’s rocking chair near the hearth, hugging Tibbers and staring into a crackling fire, where he was sure there had been nothing but cold ashes. He chalked up these slips of the mind to the burden of parenting a child alone.

Years passed, bringing more colonists to the region. And in time, Gregori met Leanna, a woman seeking a new life outside the capital with her own young daughter, Daisy.

Annie was eager for a playmate, but spoiled by the indulgences of being an only child, so acclimation to her new stepfamily was difficult. Whenever Annie’s fiery temper erupted, it left Leanna uneasy, and quick to take her own daughter’s side. It fell to Gregori to keep an uneasy peace between the three.

Unused to the dangers of the untamed borderlands, Daisy’s playing ended in catastrophe for the family. Leanna, of course, blamed Annie for the loss of her daughter, focusing her rage and grief on her stepdaughter’s most prized possession: Tibbers. Annie was horrified as the last physical memory of her mother was threatened. The girl’s terror grew to an unbridled rage, releasing her latent and powerful pyromancy, and the stuffed bear was brought to life in a maelstrom of protective fire.

When the flames died down and the swirl of ash settled, Annie was left orphaned and alone.

Believing most city adults to be like her stepmother, Annie has kept to the wilder parts of her frontier homeland. On occasion, she will use her disarmingly adorable exterior to be taken in by some pioneer family long enough to be offered new clothes and a hot meal. However, fire and death awaits anyone foolish enough to try parting Annie from the stuffed bear at her side.

Kept safe by Tibbers, she wanders the dark forests of Noxus, oblivious to danger—and the dangers posed to others by her own unchecked power—hoping, one day, to find someone like her to play with.",3549013,en,en,en

Top 4 Things You Should Know Before Applying for Immigration,misc,Elain Johnson,2021,15,{},"When you are determined to settle down as a permanent residence abroad, you should know if you are eligible for the position. Many factors surround by the immigration procedure, and most people’s application gets refused.

It happens when you lack proper information about the immigration process. This article is here to talk about the must-know issues you should keep in mind before applying for immigration or citizenship.

Make Sure You Are a Lawful Permanent Resident: Before you apply for immigration or citizenship, you should know that you live in the particular country as a lawful permanent resident for an estimated period. When you can prove it to the authority, you can apply for the citizenship process.

Otherwise, you have to go for another process, which is showing the marriage details. But in that case, you have to reach three years of stay with the citizen spouse.

You Have to Prove You are a Person with Good Character: You must ensure and demonstrate this factor to the authority when applying for your citizenship. You have to prove that there’s no criminal record of yours previously, no one’s hurt with your behaviour, and you are a person with good moral character overall.

When the inspection goes against what you show, you may have to be in trouble for that. And for any solution regarding your immigration process, you can take help from an immigration attorney in Kansas City.

Ensure Your Physical Presence in the Particular Country: The country you want to apply for citizenship can be anywhere from your current residence. But you have to show the immigration authority you have been living for a particular period in this place to apply for the procedure.

You Should Know Basic English to Apply for it: If you want a trouble-free application process for your immigration, it’s better to have your IELTS score up to the level. Make sure you know Basic English, understand and communicate with others better.

Plus, knowing the civics of the community, you will live in forever is another trait you should add in your details.",6727613,en,en,en

Nobody Knows Winesburg Ohio Chap. 6.1,misc,Sherwood Anderson,2013,39,{},"NOBODY KNOWS

Looking cautiously about, George Willard arose from his
desk in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and went
hurriedly out at the back door. The night was warm and
cloudy and although it was not yet eight o'clock, the
alleyway back of the Eagle office was pitch dark. A
team of horses tied to a post somewhere in the darkness
stamped on the hard-baked ground. A cat sprang from
under George Willard's feet and ran away into the
night. The young man was nervous. All day he had gone
about his work like one dazed by a blow. In the
alleyway he trembled as though with fright.

In the darkness George Willard walked along the
alleyway, going carefully and cautiously. The back
doors of the Winesburg stores were open and he could
see men sitting about under the store lamps. In
Myerbaum's Notion Store Mrs. Willy the saloon keeper's
wife stood by the counter with a basket on her arm. Sid
Green the clerk was waiting on her. He leaned over the
counter and talked earnestly.
George Willard crouched and then jumped through the
path of light that came out at the door. He began to
run forward in the darkness. Behind Ed Griffith's
saloon old Jerry Bird the town drunkard lay asleep on
the ground. The runner stumbled over the sprawling
legs. He laughed brokenly.

George Willard had set forth upon an adventure. All day
he had been trying to make up his mind to go through
with the adventure and now he was acting. In the office
of the Winesburg Eagle he had been sitting since six
o'clock trying to think.

There had been no decision. He had just jumped to his
feet, hurried past Will Henderson who was reading proof
in the printshop and started to run along the alleyway.

Through street after street went George Willard,
avoiding the people who passed. He crossed and
recrossed the road. When he passed a street lamp he
pulled his hat down over his face. He did not dare
think. In his mind there was a fear but it was a new
kind of fear. He was afraid the adventure on which he
had set out would be spoiled, that he would lose
courage and turn back.
George Willard found Louise Trunnion in the kitchen of
her father's house. She was washing dishes by the light
of a kerosene lamp. There she stood behind the screen
door in the little shedlike kitchen at the back of the
house. George Willard stopped by a picket fence and
tried to control the shaking of his body. Only a narrow
potato patch separated him from the adventure. Five
minutes passed before he felt sure enough of himself to
call to her. ""Louise! Oh, Louise!"" he called. The cry
stuck in his throat. His voice became a hoarse whisper.

Louise Trunnion came out across the potato patch
holding the dish cloth in her hand. ""How do you know I
want to go out with you,"" she said sulkily. ""What makes
you so sure?""

George Willard did not answer. In silence the two
stood in the darkness with the fence between them. ""You
go on along,"" she said. ""Pa's in there. I'll come
along. You wait by Williams' barn.""

The young newspaper reporter had received a letter from
Louise Trunnion. It had come that morning to the office
of the Winesburg Eagle. The letter was brief. ""I'm
yours if you want me,"" it said. He thought it annoying
that in the darkness by the fence she had pretended
there was nothing between them. ""She has a nerve! Well,
gracious sakes, she has a nerve,"" he muttered as he
went along the street and passed a row of vacant lots
where corn grew. The corn was shoulder high and had
been planted right down to the sidewalk.
When Louise Trunnion came out of the front door of her
house she still wore the gingham dress in which she had
been washing dishes. There was no hat on her head. The
boy could see her standing with the doorknob in her
hand talking to someone within, no doubt to old Jake
Trunnion, her father. Old Jake was half deaf and she
shouted. The door closed and everything was dark and
silent in the little side street. George Willard
trembled more violently than ever.

In the shadows by Williams' barn George and Louise
stood, not daring to talk. She was not particularly
comely and there was a black smudge on the side of her
nose. George thought she must have rubbed her nose with
her finger after she had been handling some of the
kitchen pots.

The young man began to laugh nervously. ""It's warm,""
he said. He wanted to touch her with his hand. ""I'm not
very bold,"" he thought. Just to touch the folds of the
soiled gingham dress would, he decided, be an exquisite
pleasure. She began to quibble. ""You think you're
better than I am. Don't tell me, I guess I know,"" she
said drawing closer to him.

A flood of words burst from George Willard. He
remembered the look that had lurked in the girl's eyes
when they had met on the streets and thought of the
note she had written. Doubt left him. The whispered
tales concerning her that had gone about town gave him
confidence. He became wholly the male, bold and
aggressive. In his heart there was no sympathy for her.
""Ah, come on, it'll be all right. There won't be anyone
know anything. How can they know?"" he urged.

They began to walk along a narrow brick sidewalk
between the cracks of which tall weeds grew. Some of
the bricks were missing and the sidewalk was rough and
irregular. He took hold of her hand that was also rough
and thought it delightfully small. ""I can't go far,""
she said and her voice was quiet, unperturbed.

They crossed a bridge that ran over a tiny stream and
passed another vacant lot in which corn grew. The
street ended. In the path at the side of the road they
were compelled to walk one behind the other. Will
Overton's berry field lay beside the road and there was
a pile of boards. ""Will is going to build a shed to
store berry crates here,"" said George and they sat down
upon the boards.

When George Willard got back into Main Street it was
past ten o'clock and had begun to rain. Three times he
walked up and down the length of Main Street. Sylvester
West's Drug Store was still open and he went in and
bought a cigar. When Shorty Crandall the clerk came out
at the door with him he was pleased. For five minutes
the two stood in the shelter of the store awning and
talked. George Willard felt satisfied. He had wanted
more than anything else to talk to some man. Around a
corner toward the New Willard House he went whistling
softly.

On the sidewalk at the side of Winney's Dry Goods Store
where there was a high board fence covered with circus
pictures, he stopped whistling and stood perfectly
still in the darkness, attentive, listening as though
for a voice calling his name. Then again he laughed
nervously. ""She hasn't got anything on me. Nobody
knows,"" he muttered doggedly and went on his way.",149016,en,en,en
Camperdown,misc,Clarence Michael James Stanislaus Dennis,2013,8,{},"The dignity of Camperdown
Is not to be denied,
Where Leura looks upon the town
And that lush countryside
And comfortable, stout and sleek,
She wears the air of one who'd seek
To mind her manners rather much,
And cultivate the English touch.

A haughty lady prone to row
Her eyebrows, when the road
Brings in some traveller whose ways
Tend to offend her code.
The robust life of modern towns
Suits ill her verdant dells and downs.
She is particular, aloof;
As witness many a manor roof.

'Tis said that Leura, long ago,
Belched flames up to the sky,
And turbulently sought to throw
Stones at the passers-by.
And her rich ashes raining down,
Bequeathed great wealth to Camperdown;
But turbulence in youth begun,
Is now taboo. It 'isn't done'.
And Camperdown, of gracious mien,
Brings joy to him who views
The glamor of her peaceful scene
And placid avenues;
A proper town, that sets the pace,
And sets the scene for civic grace.
And will might many another town
Adopt the air of Camperdown.",276362,en,en,en

Yea, a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses,
And faith he went the pace and went it blind,
And the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin,
But to-day the Sergeant's something less than kind.

And it's sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell,
To dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops

And branded with a blasted worsted spur,
When you envy, O how keenly, one poor Tommy being cleanly
Who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you ""Sir"".

Can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer?
When the drunken comrade mutters and the great guard-lantern gutters
And the horror of our fall is written plain,
Every secret, self-revealing on the aching white-washed ceiling,
Do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain?

We have done with Hope and Honour, we are lost to Love and Truth,
We are dropping down the ladder rung by rung,
And the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth.
God help us, for we knew the worst too young!
Our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence,
Our pride it is to know no spur of pride,
And the Curse of Reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us

The service cart was crying.  The betaphenethylamine gave it a voice.  It wouldn't stop.  Not in the crowded gallery, the long corridors, not as it passed the black glass entrance to the T-A crypt, the vaults where the cold had seeped so gradually into old Ashpool's dreams.
The transit was an extended rush for Case, the movement of the cart indistinguishable from the insane momentum of the overdose.  When the cart died, at last, something beneath the seat giving up with a shower of white sparks, the crying stopped.
The thing coasted to a stop three meters from the start of 3Jane's pirate cave.
`How far, mon?'  Maelcum helped him from the sputtering cart as an integral extinguisher exploded in the thing's engine compartment, gouts of yellow powder squirting from louvers and service points.  The Braun tumbled from the back of the seat and hobbled off across the imitation sand, dragging one useless limb behind it.  `You mus' walk, mon.'  Maelcum took the deck and construct, slinging the shock cords over his shoul der.
The trodes rattled around Case's neck as he followed the Zionite.  Riviera's holos waited for them, the torture scenes and the cannibal children.  Molly had broken the triptych.  Maelcum ignored them.
`Easy,' Case said, forcing himself to catch up with the striding figure.  `Gotta do this right.'
Maelcum halted, turned, glowering at him, the Remington in his hands.  `Right, mon?  How's right?'
`Got Molly in there, but she's out of it.  Riviera, he can throw holos.  Maybe he's got Molly's fletcher.'  Maelcum nod ded.  `And there's a ninja, a family bodyguard.'
Maelcum's frown deepened.  `You listen, Babylon mon,' he said.  `I a warrior.  But this no m' fight, no Zion fight Babylon fightin' Babylon, eatin' i'self, ya know?  But Jah seh I an' I t' bring Steppin' Razor outa this.'
Case blinked.
`She a warrior,' Maelcum said, as if it explained everything.  `Now you tell me, mon, who I _not_ t' kill.'
`3Jane,' he said, after a pause.  `A girl there.  Has a kinda white robe thing on, with a hood.  We need her.'

When they reached the entrance, Maelcum walked straight in, and Case had no choice but to follow him.
3Jane's country was deserted, the pool empty.  Maelcum handed him the deck and the construct and walked to the edge of the pool.  Beyond the white pool furniture, there was dark ness, shadows of the ragged, waist-high maze of partially demolished walls.
The water lapped patiently against the side of the pool.
`They're here,' Case said.  `They gotta be.'
Maelcum nodded.
The first arrow pierced his upper arm.  The Remington roared, its meter of muzzle-flash blue in the light from the pool.  The second arrow struck the shotgun itself, sending it spinning across the white tiles.  Maelcum sat down hard and fumbled at the black thing that protruded from his arm.  He yanked at it.
Hideo stepped out of the shadows, a third arrow ready in a slender bamboo bow.  He bowed.
Maelcum stared, his hand still on the steel shaft.
`The artery is intact,' the ninja said.  Case remembered Molly's description of the man who'd killed her lover.  Hideo was another.  Ageless, he radiated a sense of quiet, an utter calm.  He wore clean, frayed khaki workpants and soft dark shoes that fit his feet like gloves, split at the toes like tabi socks.  The bamboo bow was a museum piece, but the black alloy quiver that protruded above his left shoulder had the look of the best Chiba weapons shops.  His brown chest was bare and smooth.
`You cut my thumb, mon, wi' secon' one,' Maelcum said.
`Coriolis force,' the ninja said, bowing again.  `Most dif ficult, slow-moving projectile in rotational gravity.  It was not intended.'
`Where's 3Jane?'  Case crossed to stand beside Maelcum.  He saw that the tip of the arrow in the ninja's bow was like a double-edged razor.  `Where's Molly?'
`Hello, Case.'  Riviera came strolling out of the dark behind Hideo, Molly's fletcher in his hand.  `I would have expected Armitage, somehow.  Are we hiring help out of that Rasta cluster now?'
`Armitage is dead.'
`Armitage never existed, more to the point, but the news hardly comes as a shock.'
`Wintermute killed him.  He's in orbit around the spindle.'
Riviera nodded, his long gray eyes glancing from Case to Maelcum and back.  `I think it ends here, for you,' he said.
`Where's Molly?'
The ninja relaxed his pull on the fine, braided string, low ering the bow.  He crossed the tiles to where the Remington lay and picked it up.  `This is without subtlety,' he said, as if to himself.  His voice was cool and pleasant.  His every move was part of a dance, a dance that never ended, even when his body was still, at rest, but for all the power it suggested, there was also a humility, an open simplicity.
`It ends here for her, too,' Riviera said.
`Maybe 3Jane won't go for that, Peter,' Case said, uncertain of the impulse.  The derms still raged in his system, the old fever starting to grip him, Night City craziness.  He remembered moments of grace, dealing out on the edge of things, where he'd found that he could sometimes talk faster than he could think.
The gray eyes narrowed.  `Why, Case?  Why do you think that?'
Case smiled.  Riviera didn't know about the simstim rig.  He'd missed it in his hurry to find the drugs she carried for him.  But how could Hideo have missed it?  And Case was certain the ninja would never have let 3Jane treat Molly without first checking her for kinks and concealed weapons.  No, he decided, the ninja knew.  So 3Jane would know as well.
`Tell me, Case,' Riviera said, raising the pepperbox muzzle of the fletcher.
Something creaked, behind him, creaked again.  3Jane pushed Molly out of the shadows in an ornate Victorian bathchair, its tall, spidery wheels squeaking as they turned.  Molly was bun dled deep in a red and black striped blanket, the narrow, caned back of the antique chair towering above her.  She looked very small.  Broken.  A patch of brilliantly white micropore covered her damaged lens; the other flashed emptily as her head bobbed with the motion of the chair.
`A familiar face,' 3Jane said, `I saw you the night of Peter's show.  And who is this?'
`Maelcum,' Case said.
`Hideo, remove the arrow and bandage Mr. Malcolm's wound.'
Case was staring at Molly, at the wan face.
The ninja walked to where Maelcum sat, pausing to lay his bow and the shotgun well out of reach, and took something from his pocket.  A pair of bolt cutters.  `I must cut the shaft,' he said.  `It is too near the artery.'  Maelcum nodded.  His face was grayish and sheened with sweat.
Case looked at 3Jane.  `There isn't much time,' he said.
`For whom, exactly?'
`For any of us.'  There was a snap as Hideo cut through the metal shaft of the arrow.  Maelcum groaned.
`Really,' Riviera said, `it won't amuse you to hear this failed con artist make a last desperate pitch.  Most distasteful, I can assure you.  He'll wind up on his knees, offer to sell you his mother, perform the most boring sexual favors...'
3Jane threw back her head and laughed.  `Wouldn't I, Pe ter?'
`The ghosts are gonna mix it tonight, lady,' Case said.  `Wintermute's going up against the other one, Neuromancer.  For keeps.  You know that?'
3Jane raised her eyebrows.  `Peter's suggested something like that, but tell me more.'
`I met Neuromancer.  He talked about your mother.  I think he's something like a giant ROM construct, for recording per sonality, only it's full RAM.  The constructs think they're there, like it's real, but it just goes on forever.'
3Jane stepped from behind the bathchair.  `Where?  Describe the place, this construct.'
`A beach.  Gray sand, like silver that needs polishing.  And a concrete thing, kinda bunker...'  He hesitated.  `It's nothing fancy.  Just old, falling apart.  If you walk far enough, you come back to where you started.'
`Yes,' she said.  `Morocco.  When Marie-France was a girl, years before she married Ashpool, she spent a summer alone on that beach, camping in an abandoned blockhouse.  She for mulated the basis of her philosophy there.'
Hideo straightened, slipping the cutters into his workpants.  He held a section of the arrow in either hand.  Maelcum had his eyes closed, his hand clapped tight around his bicep.  `I will bandage it,' Hideo said.
Case managed to fall before Riviera could level the fletcher for a clear shot.  The darts whined past his neck like supersonic gnats.  He rolled, seeing Hideo pivot through yet another step of his dance, the razored point of the arrow reversed in his hand, shaft flat along palm and rigid fingers.  He flicked it underhand, wrist blurring, into the back of Riviera's hand.  The fletcher struck the tiles a meter away.
Riviera screamed.  But not in pain.  It was a shriek of rage, so pure, so refined, that it lacked all humanity.
Twin tight beams of light, ruby red needles, stabbed from the region of Riviera's sternum.
The ninja grunted, reeled back, hands to his eyes, then found his balance.
`Peter,' 3Jane said, `Peter, what have you _done?'_
`He's blinded your clone boy,' Molly said flatly.
Hideo lowered his cupped hands.  Frozen on the white tile, Case saw whisps of steam drift from the ruined eyes.
Riviera smiled.
Hideo swung into his dance, retracing his steps.  When he stood above the bow, the arrow, and the Remington, Riviera's smile had faded.  He bent -- bowing, it seemed to Case -- and found the bow and arrow.
`You're blind,' Riviera said, taking a step backward.
`Peter,' 3Jane said, `don't you know he does it in the dark?  Zen.  It's the way he practices.'
The ninja notched his arrow.  `Will you distract me with your holograms now?'
Riviera was backing away, into the dark beyond the pool.  He brushed against a white chair; its feet rattled on the tile.  Hideo's arrow twitched.
Riviera broke and ran, throwing himself over a low, jagged length of wall.  The ninja's face was rapt, suffused with a quiet ecstasy.
Smiling, he padded off into the shadows beyond the wall, his weapon held ready.
`Jane-lady,' Maelcum whispered, and Case turned, to see him scoop the shotgun from the tiles, blood spattering the white ceramic.  He shook his locks and lay the fat barrel in the crook of his wounded arm.  `This take your head off, no Babylon doctor fix it.'
3Jane stared at the Remington.  Molly freed her arms from the folds of the striped blanket, raising the black sphere that encased her hands.  `Off,' she said, `get it off.'
Case rose from the tiles, shook himself.  `Hideo'll get him, even blind?' he asked 3Jane.
`When I was a child,' she said, `we loved to blindfold him.  He put arrows through the pips in playing cards at ten meters.'
`Peter's good as dead anyway,' Molly said.  `In another twelve hours, he'll start to freeze up.  Won't be able to move, his eyes is all.'
`Why?'  Case turned to her.
`I poisoned his shit for him,' she said.  `Condition's like Parkinson's disease, sort of.'
3Jane nodded.  `Yes.  We ran the usual medical scan, before he was admitted.'  She touched the ball in a certain way and it sprang away from Molly's hands.  `Selective destruction of the cells of the _substantia nigra._  Signs of the formation of a Lewy body.  He sweats a great deal, in his sleep.'
`Ali,' Molly said, ten blades glittering, exposed for an instant.  She tugged the blanket away from her legs, revealing the inflated cast.  `It's the meperidine.  I had Ali make me up a custom batch.  Speeded up the reaction times with higher temperatures.  _N_-methyl-4-phenyl-1236,' she sang, like a child reciting the steps of a sidewalk game, `tetra-hydro-pyridene.'
`A hotshot,' Case said.
`Yeah,' Molly said, `a real slow hotshot.'
`That's appalling,' 3Jane said, and giggled.
It was crowded in the elevator.  Case was jammed pelvis to pelvis with 3Jane, the muzzle of the Remington under her chin.  She grinned and ground against him.  `You stop,' he said, feeling helpless.  He had the gun's safety on, but he was terrified of injuring her, and she knew it.  The elevator was a steel cylinder, under a meter in diameter, intended for a single pas senger.  Maelcum had Molly in his arms.  She'd bandaged his wound, but it obviously hurt him to carry her.  Her hip was pressing the deck and construct into Case's kidneys.
They rose out of gravity, toward the axis, the cores.
The entrance to the elevator had been concealed beside the stairs to the corridor, another touch in 3Jane's pirate cave decor.
`I don't suppose I should tell you this,' 3Jane said, craning her head to allow her chin to clear the muzzle of the gun, `but I don't have a key to the room you want.  I never have had one.  One of my father's Victorian awkwardnesses.  The lock is mechanical and extremely complex.'
`Chubb lock,' Molly said, her voice muffled by Maelcum's shoulder, `and we got the fucking key, no fear.'
`That chip of yours still working?' Case asked her.
`It's eight twenty-five, PM, Greenwich fucking Mean,' she said.
`We got five minutes,' Case said, as the door snapped open behind 3Jane.  She flipped backward in a slow somersault, the pale folds of her djellaba billowing around her thighs.

Project Shamrock,misc,Bruce Schneier,2013,40,{},"December 29, 2005

Project SHAMROCK...was an espionage exercise that involved the accumulation of all telegraphic data entering into or exiting from the United States. The Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) and its successor NSA were given direct access to daily microfilm copies of all incoming, outgoing, and transiting telegraphs via the Western Union and its associates RCA and ITT. Operation Shamrock lasted well into the 1960s when computerized operations (HARVEST) made it possible to search for keywords rather than read through all communications.

Project SHAMROCK became so successful that in 1966 the NSA and CIA set up a front company in lower Manhattan (where the offices of the telegraph companies were located) under the codename LPMEDLEY. At the height of Project SHAMROCK, 150,000 messages a month were printed and analyzed by NSA agents. In May 1975 however, congressional critics began to investigate and expose the program. As a result, NSA director Lew Allen terminated it. The testimony of both the representatives from the cable companies and of director Allen at the hearings prompted Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Sen. Frank Church to conclude that Project SHAMROCK was ""probably the largest government interception program affecting Americans ever undertaken.""

A lot of people are trying to say that it's a different world today, and that eavesdropping on a massive scale is not covered under the FISA statute, because it just wasn't possible or anticipated back then. That's a lie. Project Shamrock began in the 1950s, and ran for about twenty years. It too had a massive program to eavesdrop on all international telegram communications, including communications to and from American citizens. It too was to counter a terrorist threat inside the United States. It too was secret, and illegal. It is exactly, by name, the sort of program that the FISA process was supposed to get under control.",166300,en,en,en

FOREWORD

THIS little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject of the power of thought. It is suggestive rather than explanatory, its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and perception of the truth that—

""They themselves are makers of themselves.""

by virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in enlightenment and happiness.

AS A MAN THINKETH


THOUGHT AND CHARACTER

THE aphorism, ""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,"" not only embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.

As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have appeared without them. This applies equally to those acts called ""spontaneous"" and ""unpremeditated"" as to those, which are deliberately executed.
Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry.

""Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are
By thought was wrought and built. If a man's mind
Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes
The wheel the ox behind....

..If one endure
In purity of thought, joy follows him
As his own shadow—sure.""

Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things. A noble and Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts. An ignoble and bestial character, by the same process, is the result of the continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts.

Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace. By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master.

Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this—that man is the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and shaper of condition, environment, and destiny.

As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may make himself what he wills.

Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master who misgoverns his ""household."" When he begins to reflect upon his condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. Such is the conscious master, and man can only thus become by discovering within himself the laws of thought; which discovery is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience.

Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained, and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny, he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power. In this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that ""He that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;"" for only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge.",380349,en,en,en

The hard part,misc,Clare Jones,2017,9,{},"The new root of the fern is the part you eat in famine.
Harsh words are spoken, but they’re not the ones that make you turn.
Where the muscle’s smooth. That’s where it doesn’t fray.
The hard part is what comes easy. The hard part isn’t hard.

It only seems. It only seems. It only seems that way.
The snail inside the shell is tough. It holds the tooth, not tongue.
The fingernail. The hair. What the old ropes come from.
What’s left, dug up, and laid aside. Not the nick that never healed.

There are lice that live inside the quill of every feather of every bird.
You spoil it with a fingerprint. Artichokes have hearts.
The alligator pear has an endosperm that, when squeezed, weeps only oil.

John Doe No. 24 Live - One Night Lonely,country,Mary Chapin Carpenter,2021,16,{},"[Verse 1]
I was standing on the sidewalk in 1945
In Jacksonville, Illinois
When asked what my name was there came no reply
They said I was a deaf and sightless half-wit boy
But Louis was my name, though I could not say it
I was born and raised in New Orleans
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it
On a barge and a prayer upstream
Well, they searched for mother
And they searched for father
And they searched till they searched no more
And the doctors put to rest their scientific tests
And they named me 'John Doe No. 24'
And they all shook their heads in pity
For a world so silent and dark
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery
But so too is the human heart
And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crepe jasmine bloomed on St. Charles Avenue
Though I couldn't hear the bells
Of the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew
And if I were an old man returning
With my satchel and porkpie hat
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon
And I'd hit everyone on Basin after that
[Verse 2]
Well, the years kept passing as they passed me around
From one state ward to another
Like I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found
Always missing the other
And they gave me a harp last Christmas
And all the nurses took a dance
Well, lately I've been growing listless
I've been dreaming again of the past
I'm wandering down to the banks
Of the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand
I am seven years old and I feel my daddy
Let go of my hand
While I drew breath no one missed me
So they won't on the day that I cease
Put a sprig of crepe jasmine with me
To remind me of New Orleans

One of Them Nights,country,Chris Young,2021,715,{},"[Verse 1]
Small town, sundown
Words done got around
Somethin' goin' down around here
Left at the stop sign
Just past the county line
Bring it on, bring your own beer

[Verse 2]
Back in the backwoods
Got a couple real good
Jars of Mountain Dew
There's an old dirt road
Where the good times grow
And I don't know about you

[Chorus]
But it feels like one of them nights
It's finally Friday, gonna get right
Hay field lookin' like a runway
Blow them speakers on some country
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout, y'all
No closin' time, don't need a last call
The man in the moon's gonna leave on the lights
Drop it into four-wheel, feels like one of them nights

Barbed wire, mud tire
Throw a pallet on the fire
We've been waitin' all week
Shoes on the floorboard
Creek bank, dance floor
Sounds like a party to me

And barstool get to know ya a little better
Don't mean to pry
But I overheard you say he said goodbye
And I thought that maybe I could be the guy
To clear that mind of yours
If you want, I reckon we can turn this

How'd he ever let himself let another old John Wayne

I was city bound couldn't wait to get outta this town
Suddenly everything just changed
Something told me i just might stay

Holding hands staying up all night
Swinging stars from satelittes

Patches,country,George Jones & B.B. King,1994,2778,{},"[Intro]
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
Why I was so ragged folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
But deep down inside dad was hurtin'
'Cause he done the best he could

[Verse 1]
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
Education that he never had
But he did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops we raised
Barely paid the bills we made

[Verse 2]
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Placed his hands on my shoulder and with tears he said
[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Verse 4]
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See I was the oldest of the family
And everybody was depending on me

[Verse 5]
Now here's the path that everybody's on
Mamas been living in a brand new home
Lord, knows it took a lot of sweat and tears
And my daddy's blood to help us through the teas

[Chorus]
Patches, I'm depending on you son to pull the family through
My son, it's all, it's up to you

[Interlude]
Daddy had been sick for a long time, flat on his back
Every evening after we'd finished our chores and eat our dinner
We'd all go into papa's room to cheer him up a little
And this particular day, Dad was in good spirits
Sitting on his side of the bed telling mama how good she looked
When all of a sudden papa had a pain in his chest
I was too young to understand, talking about a heart attack here
Mama rushed all of us out of the room into the hallway
About ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes
She called out to me, ""Patches, patches get in here boy
You're daddy want to see you.""
I went running to papa's room, there papa lay
Daddy had tears in his eyes, I knew something was wrong
'Cause daddy was a poor man but all of his life he'd been a proud man
I knelt down on one knee beside the bed, papa put his hand on my shoulder
He said, ""Patches, Patches boy, the hammer of life done beat
Your old papa down to the ground and I ain't got nobody
To turn to to take care of mama and the young ones.""
""So, what I want you to do is promise me son
Is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama
As much as you can, I said, ""Papa, I'm gonna do my best.""
But little did I know then like I know right now
That trying to climb life's mountain
Searching for a top when there ain't no top
Sometimes you find yourself frustrated, lazy
But every time I feel like I can't live my life like I want to
My mind goes back to the day when I see those tears in my daddy's eyes
But most of all I remember his words
""Patches, I'm depending on you boy.""
Every time I feel like giving up I hear his voice
""Patches, Patches, Patches, Patches.""
[Verse 6]
""I'm depending on you son
I tried to do me best, it's up to you to do the rest.""
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best, it up to you to do the rest.""
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do me best, it's up to you to do the rest.""

Little More You,country,Josh Abbott Band,2019,3839,{},"[Verse 1]
It was right about sunset
She was sitting pretty on the front step
She said, ""hey baby, are you done yet?
Are you gonna work all day?""
I started walking up the driveway
She said, ""I'm headed inside, babe""
Before the screen door slammed
She turned and asked if I needed anything

[Chorus]
I said this cup could use a little more whiskey
This porch could use a little more swing
This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
This world could use a little more country
The sky could use a little more blue
Those bees could use a little more honey
And I could use a little more you

[Verse 2]
Trees swaying when the wind blows
Record playing in the window
Yeah we're taking it real slow while the crickets sing for us
She's got her legs hanging over me
There's no telling where the night might lead
When your kisses are sweet as sweet can be
I can never get enough

This cup could use a little more whiskey
This porch could use a little more swing
This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
This world could use a little more country
The sky could use a little more blue
Those bees could use a little more honey
And I could use a little more you
And I could use a little more you

Oh these arms could use a little holding
And yours could use a little more too
But we both could use a little more loving
And I could use a little more

This porch could use a little more swing
This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
