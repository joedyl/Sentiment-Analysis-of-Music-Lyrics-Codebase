When everything is golden
Nobody will feel golden
Living like they gods
So we call em fucking odin
Boats were never rowing
Beats were always flowing
Homies found a place to be going
To find their passion
To follow their dreams
But you cannot dream, when your awake
Everybody just woke up
Models gonna throw up
Homie when you gonna grow up
I froze up
When I realized
That I've getting older
Used to be 7 years old
Now a 15 year old man
I only got one plan
Only got this one life
So I
Felt something was missing
So we started searching
The whole world started turning
My vision started blurring
By the time I came back
Everything was diffrent
Everything has changed man
So much shit was missing
So I went up on a mission
To re-fix the system
That we all call living
That clock just keeps on ticking

Its sweet like honey, when I die its gon' taste like the Ramen
Ramen that I used to eat on Tuesdays, fuck what you make
Climbing up the ladder, this is Doomsday, where the crew stay
Signs of pitty patter from the crusade, thats a touché
Lines of ""whats the matter"" from my roommate, nothing to say
As I wake up from my dream, this shit ain't what it seems
A song to take up on thе screen, then you should've just seen
The look that brought up on thе scene, man it wasn't so keen
It shook him up, the certain thing that it wasn't so clean
He was writing lyrics just to make the people hear it
Despite the fearing, it was too fake, didn't put sincere in
And thats the clearance, he's not the one that was made for steering
I fight the spirit, plus I steer it, man I mean this dearest

Pause for a second as I get another weapon to kill these adolescents
And thats just with my deadly presence
I take a gamble on life with a pair of dice for paradise
And since its not making cents, its really hard to pay the price
And then I figured out that there's no second chances
I skipped out on heaven to chill where the devil dances
To only see that that demons that were haunting me was self inflicted pain that was given' to me mentally
So I, started to smoke it away
Thought it was a clear escape and kept telling myself that ""it's okay""
But as these blunts keep getting rolled up
I keep getting shortness of breath and my words get choked up
I might as well not put myself through this abysmal hell
The only thing I want in life is to prevail
To tell my grandchildren all of my greatest tails
About this young hero who achieved his own holy grail

Just know there's no net at the bottom,this ain't a stunt
You get more than a bump tryna front on my progress
Im high but not too high to not see the devil in a blue dress
With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity
And I won't see defeat, victory is kicking up yo feet
Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street
I promote change but not the type to act strange
Change to better yourself and do better things

I walked through fire and got burned, what did I learn
That every adult sins and it was just my turn
Ima firm believer in hit your head to keep it up
Cause you was looking down instead of looking up
Hard to see where you going with your eyes closed
You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

I got money but can't afford happiness what could I buy
Maybe a slice of pie or a piece of mind
Who am I, if I can't touch the Sky, a penguin
I taught I saw a putty cat inside brave men
Hoped ya peeped the quotes, they free but in the same boat
They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

You want beef, the top of your physique will hit the concrete
I rap like Iraq and bomb like Saddam
Rock a spot on your block that your clique's clocking on
A lot of little brains and names are flaming out the middle
So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole

Some medicate, some pray for saviors
Some put in work, some call in favors
Don't call it luck, it's the fruit of my labor

No I'm not sharing my earnings, unless you've been sharing my pain

Surfing Instagram on my Apple phone - no way!

Yeah
Never invested it, but felt like Axelrod Bobby
Spent a half on my Stans which are white and green
A couple of kickz is worth of fucking routine
My Instagram is opened on pages of business bloggers
Bentleys at the background , they all draped in suits and loafers
Double tap on their pictures the only thing that I do
Instead of building my life I flush the time down the tube

I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine

This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword
Hip-Hop's a holocaust, grab ya holy cross, ya crescent and star
Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah
Refer to ya bibles, Qu'ran and Torah

Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze

I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders

We got the area secured now, triple the c-4
And get of the whole floor, you copy?
I copy that, we got the whole music business wired
So when this shit blow, ya whole empire's expired

At times I might waver
Sweet as a life saver
But sharp as a knife razor

And facts brought to back block against the trash talk
Blast off when my 10 toes touch the asphalt

Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears
You gonna switch your gears and push till shit's clear yes sir

Let me breathe; trapped in memories
I can't eat, I'll just weep
Guess I killed who I used to be
I'm a mess, I'm fucked up
Yeah, the slut wasted all my love
Got straight A's, all I was
But who am I once highschools up?

We were told how we should be; now we live in disbelieve
Of the people that we meet, so we stick to memories
And your parents aren't in love; we have holes inside our hearts
Things will end up in th past; the pain ain't meant to last

Moved out west; still searching for something
Took a year for me to stop running
And all my friends, they love who I found and
Will stick with me until the end

[majora]
Fuck all your highschool parties; we in the skudio living the dream
And we don't turn back for sorries; they used to look at me weird in the streets
Thinking 'bout all of these lonely nights, I'm glad that it's over now
Fuck it, it's over now
I've been so low, you can't hold me down

Fuck all your highschool parties; I don't even wanna know nobody
You look at me all worried; look at yourself and tell me you ain't boring

Yeah, I know I look different
You're trying hard to fit into your system
Inside your mind, you got all of it twisted
That is the reason I won't be the victim

Why are you so close minded?
You got all these opportunities but choose to be blinded
Brank Boyz pull up to your party, we ain't even invited
Just to show you what's up; yeah, we don't give a fuck, yeah, yeah

[majora]
Things change, but I won't forget
Ain't nobody used to check up on me when my thoughts collapsed and
Now I try my best to rid old habits; need to redefine the shit I called friendship
Yeah, all my friends are going through it sometimes, but at least we're all inside this shit together
Fuck all your highschool parties; we in the skudio living the dream
And we don't turn back for sorries; they used to look at me weird in the streets

Apparently my lyricism is awokening
Nature boy, think I got my third eye opening
Niggas bite the dust and it be so chokening
You won't find that one if you go Google searching it
Never work for anything, swag already purchased it
Selling my emotions and the damage so permanent

Forget about my health, hope the blunt has got sherm in it
I'm the point where I can't even talk to anybody

Chop me up, chopper, chopper, chop a fucking Harley
Davidson? Maybe I can reckon a Beckham
I met a girl about as fucked as I am
Rock the boat, shipping like its #ziam
We're fucking sad so she cries on my dick
I'ma cry in her pussy and sniffle those inner lips
Lay under stars and we talk about the universe
Mentioned God and it made the conversation worse
But tell me this, how does conversation work?
Tired voice, so she think that I was sipping purp
My parents probably unaware of half the shit I do
But I guess I spilled the tea on the track, oops
There's some things that I guess will never change in you
I'd still fuck Ellen Page if she want me to
I'd still fuck Jennifer Lawrence if she want me to
I'd still fuck Emma Stone if she want me to

As I carry on with my life
Wondering if I was ever meant to have a wife
Wondering if I'll have some kids and call 'em mine
I'm on this earth and I only have a little time

Was roaming these neighborhood’s funny we know
The outcome of crime guess God gave us a conscious too
So The only way to fly out the block was to be Lebron and
Pray to God that one day these new casters would come
They Casper see they didn’t show up we traded Spaulding for guns
And trapping keys like we stacking bricks on my mommas lawns
My Homie in the cell doing time like Rolex watch, The only things
That matters to him to watch the clocks, reminiscing on patience
Them day you didn’t know hatred, phone chirping from girls so when
You had they digits you made it, Pillow talks from this lil momma

Boys in the furnace

Splitting my hand, blood on my guitar
If I add the sweat and tears someday I'll be a star
I dream to have my name in lights, people cheering my name

Yeah
[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I hear them in the crowd, shouting out ""let them speak""
Before the bullets fly, I'm arriving at my peace
And it's there for a second. Gone in a blink
So I don't need a ride I'll drive myself to the brink
Dearly departed. Dearly departed
I hope you're happy now
Look what you started

Still blow my whole day on the ember
Growing pains
But I’m growing pay

I swear that was the last time I'm gonna replace the stars
With heaven in a mason jar
Stuck with ugly faces, scarred
Makes it hard to keep composure for the camera
Still the lights flash
Now I'm frozen with my hands up
They told me what the plan was but i left it at the bus stop
Now it's probably riding down Chicago with a traffic cop
It has to stop
Or my theory's out the window
And down the street behind the building
Back where broken men go
I swear that was the last Jack Pollock I'll be splattering
Never should've dove head first into the shallow end
Hey, welcome back again
I heard you got your head stuck
Between a rock, a hard place, a gypsy and and a bread truck
I swear that was the last time I'll swear that was the last time
Last time was different 'cause I came back from a flatline
And walked around with pamphlets
Asking if you heard the good news
Looked through the stained glass
And sang the pop the hood blues
Overheated car smoke dancing out the engine block
Hot enough to tie the brutal sun into a crimson knot
Prison thoughts pace round my skull with no escape plan
Grey hands flip coins and lie wherever fate lands
[Chorus]
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
What's the use of beating old war drums for past crimes?
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
I won't come round here again until the flask's dry

[Verse 2]
It’s time to take the stand, raise your hand
Try to beat the case again
Why'd you shake the branch deeply rooted in forsaken land
It's not your place to operate on patience you keep locked away
Not today, yesterday, tomorrow
What you got to say?
No excuse, searching for words that never come
Spent your youth and all your kids'
Trying to stay forever young
Place the severed tongue of Saint Paul upon the pedestal
List the lives you'd settle for and all the truths you'll never know
Let it go, let it go, let it go forever more
Chalk it up to weathered storms
This ain't the worse you're better for
Took it down to the bone, bone marrow
Shot a lone, lone arrow at a stone, stone sparrow
Killing two birds with one word
Spell it with a searchlight
Honor it for two days and sell it on the third night
The path to hell is paved with politician's promises
A handshake, a smile, and every lie that's crossed their lips
I swear this is the last time I'll swear this is the last time
Lend a helping hand to a man that walks the path blind","rap","Last Time","2024-07-27T17:08:08.385628Z","0.8","-0.2",2015

But grime isn't good it just sounds meaningless and too rough
It doesn't make you sound good and to be honest its not tough...

Your confidence high, but you’re making mine low
I'm talking, but you ain't listening (Hello?)
Never saw you with a smile
Won’t be back home in a while or ever
You know you coulda been better
But so could have I
You don't see me depressed with these dismal eyes
Why?
I just don't think it's a matter of time
Am I getting a call to come and die? (Come and die)
I'm broken
I think I might (might, might commit suicide)
I'm broken, can you fix me?
Listening to this again might be the end of me
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
Singing this again might be the enemy

I just pray they take the shackles off
Need my people from behind the wall
I don't even wanna answer call

This some heartfelt shit, catch a hot slug
We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly
I can't go back to the snow
No boots on my feet, wit' my sneaks full of holes
Mama did her best, but she did it on her own
When I had nothing left, still got it like I'm grown

You got something to lose don't let 'em take it
Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces
Couple niggas doing life, growing ancient
I just wanna better the gang, let's get a spaceship
Roney still clean the block up, call me maintenance
Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican
Get my youngin drop a package off
Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved
'Cause my dawg behind the wall playing basketball
Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot
Roney like the sun, he can heat the block
We don't need to stop
We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot
Need my dawg from behind the wall
He locked up playing basketball

Hoping out the passenger like Trey, there he go

Throw me on that corner, get me stabbed, it's alright
Feel like nobody love me, and my heart get cold at night
For the devil creeping on me, I ain't looking for the light

Sometimes, I feel like I'm hatin' for no reason at all
But when I hit the block, there's barely no Black people at all
Or no Latinos at all, or Filipinos at all
Just art collectors and loft, do they respect us or naw?
Ridin' BART, I'm in awe, had all the wealthy techies come and go
West Oakland station, mission statement, hella comfortable
The great migration of Blacks from country to city
Is slowly but surely returnin' to how it was once befo'

Hi Mrs. Lynch, this is Mrs. Zubrod. I'm calling from Deerfield Elementary about your son, Jason. Um, I've been having a few concerns just about his ability to focus in class. There are some options that I've briefly discussed. Um, we see this a lot with children and it might be some form of ADD. I'm not a doctor so I would suggest that maybe-
Uh, Mrs. Lynch, this is Mr. Bailey, Jason's fifth-grade teacher. I'm calling 'cause I'm very concerned about your son. It seems very possible that he will not pass the fifth grade. He's been failing very regularly-
Mrs. Lynch, this is Principal Reynolds, calling again for the third time. Please give us a call back as soon as you can. Jason has been suspended from school yet again for getting into a fight. Um, he's becoming a real problem for the kids. It seems he's getting into an altercation every other day. Um, we've tried to reach out, we're trying to help him. But there's only so much I can do. Mrs. Lynch, we have no choice but to suspend your son immediately-
This is Detective Pearson with the Third District Police Department. We are searching for Jason Mills; he's been implicated in a armed robbery case. We have a good bit of evidence that Jason is involved. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible. It's nothing to worry about, hope I hear from you soon-

Who the trillest?
Who the shooter? Who got shot? Who survived?
Who diminished? Who the witness? Who detective?
Who the medic? Who the dead? Who arrested?
You the dead, you the lesson
We survived, we ain't stressin'
I was tryna live it, I was tryna be it
I lived with my mother and stepfather, both had degrees, was heated
Went the college route
But I doubt that I'm going to college now
I was tryna be flyer than Batman so I got me the strap, man
And I started stealing and turned into Robin now
I'm just a middle-class nigga who's class was a mixture
Of them spellin' bee winners and them PG killers
Flop, flop, flop, flop, hit your ass with bananas, they gorillas
Knock, knock, knock, knock at my door, asking me to come and kick it
I was different, see, my family distanced me but I was curious
The mystery of chilling down the street, knowing I shouldn't be
Was lit to me and that's the reason why that I am literally
The only one to go to jail in my family's history

[Chorus: IDK]
A ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga
Steal the strap from my neighbor's safe, brrat-brrat nigga
They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers
At the end of the day, I'm a young black nigga
I'm a ""good home, I don't give a fuck"" trap nigga

They gon' still throw my ass in the jail with the killers
At the end of the day, I'm a young black nigga

Hear the church bell ringing
Murder every rapper better start repenting
Heard of every rap you fuckers spitting
Take your herd to the lab and start re penning
Now they singing the same
With limited brains
Tryna mimic for fame
They killing the game
They will never be tame
Taking the reigns
And im making a name
You the best rapper in the school?
Call yourself a leader I will show you how to rule
On this beat defeat ya and your punishment is cruel
Ask me for a feature im a freeze ya you a fool
Think I might not kill ya you like Freiza im Goku
Wasn't gonna feed ya but this shit is getting deeper im  competing to be-seat the rappers I lampoon
Callin me a freak
You wallow in defeat
Control alt delete, you reboot I resume
Cuz Your Autotune
Is so out of tune
So now I presume
That you’re a buffoon
Take trash like raccoons
Airheads, like balloons
My bad that was criminal
You know who you are
So this is not subliminal
Pull up in a car
Your condition is now critical
Ripping up your art
What's left of it is spiritual
{Verse 2}
To tell you the truth
Its a crime scene when I get in the booth
Look at rhyme schemes its getting coo coo
Its so obscene merci beaucoup
Know what that means? That means thank you
If you don't believe search on Google
Im like chlorine I clean the pool
The one with genes that none of you knew
But im coming in through
Coming in fru-ition
With the ammunition
And on a mission
To show im different
To all these bitches
They load the clips in
And Damn they missed it
Im on some slick shit
A bomb im spitting
I take the pin and
Take the pen
And I throw the nades
Into virgin kids that
Gone ballistic
Cuz they are so lit
{Verse 3}
In quotes you see
Everything I say
Is tongue in cheek
Rappers gonna spray at my physique
Changing up the waves
Im like mystique
All they gonna say
My lines antique
Just so they remain
Right at their peak
Ima go and frame
This as perfect
Cuz I Spitfire
You’re Mozambique
Cuz I'm an old head
Fire off a diss
And now they bolted
Snakes are gna hiss
They so revolting
They soul is open
And ima close it
No room for moping
Im cold I'm frozen
Home alone ima trump
Macaulay Culkin
Writing and they stumped
On Green Im Hulking
Wannabes i corrupt
Ive barely spoken
Scary and they jump
Cuz I've awoken
From their provoking
Shaken and choking
Give rhymes in bulking
This scheme just won't end
And now they hoping
That theres a cure
For this pathogen
Disease so pure
Have to cope and
They're unsure
Doctors they phoning
{Chorus}
I'm not having any of this shit
I will handle petty disrespect
I will dismantle everything  you say
And will show you i am here to stay

{Verse 4}
One punch now run it back six zero
Touchdown bitch go and run it back
Come against me itll be fourth down you runts go punt to the field and track
Cuz your field in tracks appears to be whack
Need a peer to smack you back on track
When your backs on track
Ima prevail and derail a bitch like its Amtrak
Cuz in all degrees im meant to be mentally
The best emcee on mp3s so i just speed to hit 90
Thats the right angle on all fours form a rectangle
Find it a cute to think you obtuse
Got a screw loose cuz you're in my shadow

Wait 'til this tape drop
Pourin' up straight drop
Got a Gucci headband on like AI
I just popped ten Percs and I ain't high (Damn)

[Verse 1]
I just met up with my plug just to buy a new handgun (What up?)
Drove two hours, bought a burnout Samsung
And I bought some gift cards
And I bought a TV
Tired of my bitch, keep sayin' she wanna leave me (Bitch)
I ain't never going broke again like 3Three (3Three)
And the feds just dropped my case for identity theft
Too busy gettin' money, I ain't tryna have sex
Too busy gettin' money, I ain't gotta get a job
Do the dash on the cops, turn my shit on sports mode (Skrrt)
Got a text from the plug sayin', ""Send a big load""
Up need a few pots, he whippin' on a big stove (Stove)
Gotta stash all the shit when a nigga hit the road (Road)
Cause the shit gon' get sold
Couple bitch niggas told
Couple bitch niggas snitched
I'm just tryna get rich
Why your ho around me? Nigga, grab your bitch
Think they tryna set the plan, I'm 'bout to grab my stick (Damn)
[Chorus]
Brought my reader and my writer on the road with me
Yesterday I bought a brand new strap and it hold fifty
Nigga try to take something, I'ma give his ass the whole 50
A nigga's bitch just called my phone like, ""Baby, can I hold fifty?"" (Hello?)
Run this shit up on my own, you niggas wasn't on the road with me
Street nigga made a half a million off a laptop (Laptop)
Beat my uncle ass 'cause I caught him smokin' crack rocks (Damn)
Gave your bitch backshots
Niggas better soon as they hear the strap pop
Put a new beam on my chop like it's Black Ops (Bow)

[Verse 2]
Got a couple hologram scannable IDs
Get a VPN just to switch my IP
And I get half off with IKEA
I'm so blowed, boy, I can't see ya
And I feel just like John Cena
Your bitch asked could she hit my reefer
Got to Kony, get a pita
Fake ID, my name is Peter
Your bitch a fuckin' leecher
[Chorus]
Brought my reader and my writer on the road with me (Road with me)
Yesterday I bought a brand new strap and it hold fifty
Nigga try to take something, I'ma give his ass the whole 50 (Brrt)

Y'all could wait to exhale, I'ma vent a little
Set it off like Jada robbin' the bank
I got this money thing covered from the dollar to the franc
The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin' backwards
Nothin' y'all said made an ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out, got reversible rhymes
We could go pop with it or run the block with it
Never before done 'til The Firm did it
If it ain't for the paper, then, nah, we not with it
Got to stay driven so we can stay drivin'

​Put on a beat, play my life in reverse then write a verse
​I was in hell, dyin' of thirst, the ravens were in the trees starin' at me while they perched
​
​But my success was written before my birth
​I excel from the energy I exert
​The world cracked open when I dropped the merch
​Zombies crawlin' out of the ground clawin' the earth

​Went out to Rome, spent a weekend in Greece
​Poured liquor in a glass and rolled weed in a leaf
​Momma cried out to Jesus, ""Lord keep him in peace!""
​They stay marginalizing Yeezus and they sleepin' on me

​I keep it raw with a sexy persona
​I play my role like a professional roller
​To move around, I do golds on the front and root canals on all the rest of my molars, Petie

​I told my Momma that I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best
​Momma I'mma do my best
​They comin' for my head, they comin' for my head
​But momma I'mma do my best, I'mma do my best

​Niggas don't know shit about loyalty nowadays
​I try not to blame 'em cos they weren't raised how I was raised
​They was sneak dissin' for years so I ain't phased
​Cos i got the title belt and a head full of tidal waves
​Not to mention the ladies that I done slayed
​Layin' the younger hoes and I'm lyin' about my age
​and niggas hatin', but real recognise...
​well you know the rest of the sayin', we ain't related
​but i will say that my legacy's understated
​and the power of my penmanship can't be debated
​plus money's comin' in nowadays
​I'm elated, the car note was due yesterday and I can pay it
​
​It's the simple things that make me happy
​the girls that call me papi, my babies that call me daddy
​the fans that listen and help me like a taxi
​she got her hair straightened and came and gave me the nappy
​everybody rap but not everybody is savvy
​so i can understand why my success make you aggy
​plus your girl put my cover on that avi
​swingin' the tomohawk, you get scalped by the apache

Yeah, she was seventeen years old, life was good
Innocent young girl from a nice neighborhood
Big white house with a small picket fence
Known around school, had a choice pickin friends
You know, cheerleader, real good grades
Never smoked weed when her friends would blaze
So a bigger picture and built the framework
Mature for her age and nobody could change her
Life's unexpected, it shakes you up
So after high school, life will wake you up
She went on to University, all her friends went
Loosened up a bit and started to experiment (yeah)
Grades started slippin when the liquor started tippin
Five months later and the girl started sniffin
Six months later, she wants to drop out
Eight months later, it's over, she walks out
Parents hate it and don't accept failure (nah)
Diss on her daughter, won't write or mail her (yeah)
Lives on the streets now, kicked out her trailer (yeah)
Trick out herself to pay for drug paraphernalia
Life is funny but shit ain't a joke

Never knew his father and his mother never loved him (nah)
Nothin at his home 'cause he never had a home (nope)
Grew up on the streets, had to learn on his own
Started doin drugs at a early age
Got his first court case at the age of eight
And everybody said he's on a path to destruction
Always would remind him that he'd amount to nothin
In and out of juvenile every other year
But at seventeen starts to get his head clear
He figured out things quicker than most
'Cause he was thrown into life without guidance from his folks
You mature a lot quicker when you have to
Cleaned up his act, did what he had to
Grew tired of the drugs and the tattoos
Didn't follow in his mom's or his dad's shoes
Couldn't let the cycle continue
But he gotta eat and picks his own food from the menu
Twenty-five, now he's got a real job, wife and kids
He built his life from shit (shit ...)

Hot damn, ho (ho), here we go again (gain)
Raise up off of mines, put your elbow in
Slow your roll like your off-sets is off set
You out of line, cuz you out off line, so you off net
Leather seats all wet, paint up on the Fleetwood
On this point, Jordans on my toes, did my feet good
Still got my Coogi, my shorty got a Gucci on
Flossing on the same track I hear Big and Gucci on
Now we remixed it like it's two different packs
Of Kool-Aid in the same jug, and I'm feeling same, thug
This is for the boys in blue, and the G's flamed up
I'm in the big body slab, raised up, game up!

I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up

[Verse Two: Project Pat]
I still get if off with the soft and the hard
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Used to dodge them laws in them stolen cars
Now I'm Escalade, sitting high with the stars
Took a shine like a star, now my head is in the clouds
And I'm papered, so I'm right back on the line
Project Pat, my dog, and I'm leading half a pound
Cousin house in the bay, on the North side of town
Man, the streets in me, so I can't say I don't miss em
Dipping through the hood plucking chicks, but I don't kiss em
She wishin that I would take her home; long stick her
Then I get her back, hit it from the back and I'm gone

[Verse Three: Big Boi]
Can't be tripping bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can a nigga stop that?
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside
They try But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
But with success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, It's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow

Remember all them nights I was gone off half a pill
Eating out the box like I got a Happy Meal
I crack the whip, then your bra and panties come up missing
Asking what’s my name like Rumpelstiltskin
There ain’t no competition and you can come petition
Ain’t nobody signing that, can’t get your vagina back
That pussy mine, that’s what you told me
Then like a pinwheel, you blowed me
You said it’s been the same shit since high school
You need a lil’ more like the girl that sing with Ja Rule
Well if you need space, that’s what I’ll provide you
Michael Phelps can’t swim in a child’s pool
Besides boo, I’ma see you again
‘cause it’s his turn but it’s my tee you are in-

‘cause he don’t beat that right, and he don’t eat that right

You may have heard a lot about Rap Genius lately
But I suppose you have been looking at it rather sedately
Just another boring lyric site, nah, don't be fooled
Rap Genius ain't just a site where you get lyric-schooled
It's a collaborative annotation platform where you can explain anything
From lyrics to the Bible, we annotate everything
From TV shows to sports to the latest in games
To GRANDMA'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES...
Nah, we ain't ashamed!
So how do they get, so many annotations without paying people?
It's quite clever actually
And if you write fluently, concise, and factually
You'll eventually find yourself part of the editors faculty
Where you can be free of the white hat normality

[Verse 2: Ryan Vice]
Ayo, we branched out to all different divisions
It's not just rap, we got poetry, rock and news
Plus a whole bunch of other crap
And being a great editor, with all you contribute
Can eventually earn you the moderator attribute
And then you will be able to reign over others
Gain some power, recognise talent where it is due
Oh what... I forgot about IQ!
IQ can be a motivator for many
Writing good annotations can get you plenty
But IQ whoring?
That's a definite penalty
[Verse 3: Ryan Vice]
Ugh, one more and I'm signing out

But all this great stuff aside, you wanna know the real reason
I stay allied, to the RG fam, representin' worldwide
It's the staff yo! Their friendly in nature
Mahbod, Shawn, Tom, Jeremy, Illan, Tobias, they always stay ill 'n
They got the mastermind persona
To keep the site running
And the Tech guys are great, making sure we stay update
To the annotation platform, that has improved my love for writing
Austin, Gavin, Tomi, you guys always stay trill
And Verified Artists? Most genius thing ever
This is a great leap for man, one of raps hugest endeavors
Which works quite a charm
Getting primary perspectives
On a line that may create an interpretation dilemma
Being able to connect with rappers themselves
Establishing a deeper connection between fans and artists is great for the health!

So, now what? Is it over?
This I can't believe

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion [?]
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment
[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

[Chorus: Astrid Nora]

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""

Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh

We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting

Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes

Nighttime is what I thrive in

Workin' hard never call it quits
My current life is inadequate

This bitch is insane!
Part of me needs this, pardon me Jesus
I hope that they see this, my life will be gorgeous
In five years my house will be hidden by hills, so clearly enormous
You should've warned us: there are no shortcuts
I will make more bucks, give less fucks, live life on a tour bus

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate checkin' my phone; these Tweets are just mad distractions
Why the fuck would I ever mention you if I'm the main attraction?
I'm the prime package in this amazon
I be at your door

I feel like I'm gone family I need that
But I still need to learn to grow on my own become a better man
When I be back
Get stronger mentally, physically, hold my ability get in my zone never show hostility keep to myself keep on showing positivity

I care too much about others and not on myself
Little did I know I was slowly breaking myself
This shit wasn't good at all for my health
Stuck in the chapter that seem to never end
Wish I could travel to Netherland
Not worry about anything in another land I recommend

But life isn't a fairy tale life ain't fair as you can tell
It doesn't want to see you succeed it just wants to see you fail
But fuck that shit I rebel wanna work my way up from nothing to something and never stop until I get to the top and be able to have my own story to tell

Not going to fall in line
Fall in what everyone does
Want to have a free mind
And do what I does create my own story without any worry I made my own choice I did it so that I can grow but my girl said that is some Bullshit well I think that you should just probably go
Not everything revolves around you
Gotta do shit for myself
I really did love you but I guess now I gotta focus more on me myself

I'm on a mission I'm a young man with a lot of ambition
I miss my family I truly do miss them but when I get back they really Be able to see my transition from a little boy to a young man
Understand I was too afraid to raise my hand but here I am a young Man with a plan and this is my place this is where I stand

Things change
Friends change
If you really think things can stay the same then you're probably insane
Go to learn how to adjust to the shit
Flip the page start on a new script
Forget about the past live in the now there's no better feeling than being on the mound

Living in the moment doing what I know what to do focus on my girl feeling like the one never two I hope you understand that too

Life going fast like a fastball throwing junk like a curve ball never could fall always gotta stand tall give it my all not like a nub never make a bad call

I'm not selfish I just wanna make my choice
Sending a message so I'm using my voice
All smiles and no tears it was just all a bit
Think you know me but you don't know me at all one bit

I'm like a seed I just wanna grow
But its gonna take some time Its gonna go slow
I wish it could go faster but there's only so much that I know

It's like a...
In a jigsaw puzzle piece my son
Between the heart of autumn leaves and where the trees come from
We see the blossom in the picture puzzle needs might want
A thousand pictures that Picasso might at-least have done
Man I can i can feel the burn on these dry thumbs
It takes a man to find his inner-peace so he can finally grease thy blunt
When complications seem to tease my tongue
I find the piece a thousand times unique, so one time for the feed my crumbs
Before the moon comes down,i'll need my gut
Believing all the pictures of the puzzle got the east raised up

We ain't the people of the struggle, we the pieces of the puzzle...
And the point is to put together a picture from all the pennies and the peanuts that we hustle
Dealing with debts and the evils in the jungle but we 'bout to get it popping like a needle and a bubble...POP!

I'm just looking for the answers am i saying i'm insane
I'm deranged, by the questions in my brain and their saying
What's the purpose? (nothing)
What if it's all worthless?
What if we all live in a curse?
Yo' what's the word?
What's the verdict?

Anything but myself and the soils that I was birthed in

Would work still be waiting for you when you awake?
To come back to the home that is laid to find that the floors had been paved
No matter what is placed on the plate
One thing that we will never do is Fade
Could it be right because we all make mistakes?
It is difficult to keep it real with the fake

With plenty of space to move away but have to stay
Where one can be in the same place but in a different State

The final equation, elated to the rhyme to the audience
Haters can't relate they be tryin to start arguments
All them fools marked for death
And they toe get tagged
When a flow's dispatched, it make foes relax
And think about it a second
Before I even touch the mic and that's without a suggestion
Start countin your blessings
I'm clownin you peasants who be doubtin my message
Your style's not impressive
I'm using my time wisely, nothing can slide by me
Fools try me then at the end be like ""why me?""
Why not?
I can see your blind spot
Birds try to jock, they can go find the flock
Time is on the clock but not a second to watch
Got a plot synchronized on the dot ready-or-not
[Verse Two]
I'm takin this shit back to the essence
If anybody wanna talk shit I gotta message
Keep it to yourself or your health will be lessened
Depleting like an energy bar cause you be stressin
Stupidness
Who is this nigga up in my business?
Get his ass up out of here before I start flippin
Like channels on a remote control
I don't condone fools on the mic who can't hold they own
I'm on the throne
Zone with me, it's the ticket to the next situation gettin explicit
Now picture it physical evidence gone I'll be acquitted
Gettin funky with the linguistics that's tradition
Infliction of pain on perpetrators, wishin
To slip in my position but nah, good riddance
If you didn't chip in you can't get a bit of this
Deliberate backstabbing that's shit's ridiculous
Biatch

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yeah bitch I'mma rhyme forever
X marks the spot now go find the treasure
Funk fatality battle me? You catchin a blizzard
I got allergies affected by you wack ass niggas
Let me go and get bread spit hot lead, spread the gospel
Topple you fools that wanna pop so much shit
Fuck it time for me to flush it
Do the people justice rock my production
Hoes be lustin no you can't touch him
Follow his instructions, no he ain't fuckin'
Indestructible walk into the session
Soon as I catch the groove it's impressive
Dilapidated ya crew
Niggas fake as you?
I can't relate to you
This is for the real people who take the truth and ingest it
Let it radiate in the soul and manifest it

Verse One

I stopped writing rhymes on paper a long time ago
Cos that cannot be copy and pasted into the liner notes
And now I hardly use my MPC
Because I find it too restrictive when I’m making these beats
But yo’ I still use a valve mic
Because my vocals record clear
And people tell me that is what it sounds like
I got a PC and a Mac
So I can choose between Cubase and Logic when I build a track
The way I work is more flexible and the library of sounds available
And accessible’s tremendous, I still release music independent
The running time of my catalogue is endless
I’m more meticulous listening to audio
To make better music for the people who support me yo’
So for the fans who reach out with the messages
The Africans, Asians, English and Americans
My people in Europe, Australia, Canadians
I hope the music I make will bring some radiance into your life
Could be the words that I’m saying
Or the beats that are playing that can keep you maintaining
Hah’, so let me end this on a dope note
Something you can tell to all your people’s as a dope quote
You may have heard it before, but yo’ it’s mad sick

OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many

Just for reference, and I may re-post this as I see fit, here is my rough criteria for judging. Obviously, since this is text based, it’s much easier to disregard rhetorical flourishes, so don’t expect to get points for claims you don’t back up. Anyways:Demonstrates an intricate understanding of how (not necessarily to what extent..) their album impacted Hip Hop culture.Differentiates between cultural implications of Hip Hop as a sociopolitical platform, and Rap (i.e. rhyming words over a beat to create multi-rhythmic patterns) as an art form.Clearly states their main points of argument, and continually refers back to them in order to clarify their reasoning.Supports their main points with some sort of verifiable evidence, observable on a wide-scale. Anecdotes can be insightful, but they have no place supporting an argument for or against.Demonstrates basic critical thinking skills.Novel arguments or reasoning, which aren’t widely seen in any one of the thousands of This album vs. That album threads scattered across this forum already. Seriously, I don’t want to read arguments I’ve heard a hundred times, especially if you can’t offer up any sort of new information to support these arguments.Otherwise, this debate really has almost nothing to do with which album is actually “better”, so don’t expect to get an easy win just because you lucked out with a critically/commercially claimed album. Along those same lines, I’m expecting even more from you if you do have a favorable match up

Arobie1992:

Pretty much everything SR covered looks good. Here's some stuff I specifically wanted to address for my judging criteria:The argument being made is more important than the format of the entry, though I am somewhat partial to essays.If the entry is in essay format, I'm looking for good usage of grammar and writing. It doesn't have to be perfect, but there shouldn't be simple typos (e.g. apart vs. a part, alot instead of a lot, etc.). Follow the rules here and you'll be good.Arguments should aim for objectivity. Entirely subjective reasoning will only serve to hurt your argument.I highly recommend using outside sources, which should be referred to.Able to relate different aspects to each other (e.g. social impact to commercial success).Demonstrate an understanding of each of the aspects you discuss beyond a basic level. So for example, if you talk about lyrical quality, discuss why the lyrics are better than your opponent's album's lyrics.Length is irrelevant. The submission should be as long as you feel it needs to be to cover everything you want to discuss in adequate depth, but no longer.Again, the goal of this is not whose album is better, but who can provide the more well-reasoned, compelling argument for why their album is better/more important/whatever. As SR said, just because you have what you, or even many, may consider to be a superior album, don't expect to be able to slack. If it's famous, it's famous for a reason, and we're going to expect you to know, understand, and articulate those reasons clearly and concisely

MrXercules:

To be added

HashSlingingSlasher:

Here are some of the things I am looking for:Good, solid evidence. Don't just include your opinions, even if you can back those opinions up. You should also give some statistics, expert opinions, etc. Something that is actually hard, solid evidence, and not just subjectiveClarity of ideas. Make sure that you explain yourself thoroughly. Remember, this can be as long as you like, so don't be afraid to be wordy. Make sure that you ideas are well thought out and easy to understand. If you can't explain an idea well, or can't support it enough, then that is probably a sign that the idea isn't really good enough to be included. A thesis statement might be a good idea hereI'm a bit of a grammar nazi. You don't have to be 100% right 100% of the time, but at least make it evident that you really attempted to have correct grammar and spelling. Remember, spellcheck is your friend, and if you really aren't good with grammar, then you could always have someone else read your writing to make sure it is correctFocus on all aspects of your album. Not just the lyricism, or the flow. Get into the producing as well. Make sure you know your album like you know the back of your hand. Discuss every part of it that you think proves it's greatnessJust like in any debate, don't leave any ""chinks in your armor"", so to speak. If your album has a weak point, don't just try to ignore it, or your opponent (and myself) will notice. Don't try to sweep things under the rug. If you are leaving holes in your defense, they will be found and exploited

And most of all...Proofread! Seriously, this is one of my pet peeves. After you are ""done"", read through your essay a few times. Any grammatical errors? Any spelling errors? Any ideas that don't seem well thought out or that seem skimpy? Keep reading through it until you don't find anything that you want to changeAfarese:

Basically everything the other judges said will apply for me as well, but here are the things I will most be looking at:Good grammar. It doesn't have to look like an English scholar wrote it, but it should have few mistakes in spelling and punctuation. Mixing up ""there"" with ""they're"" or ""to"" and ""too"" should be avoidedDemonstrates a good amount of knowledge on how the album impacted hip-hopThe argument should not be subjective and state just opinions, the argument should be objective and state factsUses outside information, such as commercial performance, critical reception, or professional reviews. Not mandatory but highly recommendedDemonstrates that the album was listened to and analyzed, and argument well thought out rather than just being thrown togetherAlso, as stated before this is not about who's album is better. An argument could be a great album vs a terrible album, but if the terrible album's argument is explained better then it will win. The more well thought out argument that shows that you listened to the album and analyzed it well","rap","Judges Criteria","2024-07-29T18:04:29.447459Z","0.6","0.4",2014

Words deny such a marvelous lullaby
But a baby’s smile shows the big folks what is real

To the lady old and gray:

That was before the money came raining down on us

And my body is barely keeping up
And one day, it won’t keep up any more

I’ll go sailing through the clouds (crowds)

On a Solar Highway to my god

I’m still healthy
Sitting in the morning sun
With no one around to sit down next to me
