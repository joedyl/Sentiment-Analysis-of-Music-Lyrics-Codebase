Go head go head go head and jump
Just know there's no net at the bottom,this ain't a stunt
You get more than a bump tryna front on my progress
Im high but not too high to not see the devil in a blue dress
With a pig face and silver badge assassinating
Like Jason Statham hit men killing brown men congratulations
You transformed to a game and played yourself
Tried to put a dome on my dome but I passed yo shelf
Read this book don't judge by the cover
I'm dangerous cause my mind is lethal like Danny glover
And I suffer from rebelling corrupted authority
They mad cause unlike the majority I refuse conformity
And I won't see defeat, victory is kicking up yo feet
Looking down a thousand feet at the ants on the street
I promote change but not the type to act strange
Change to better yourself and do better things

I fall but not too far down
Get up, i gotta swim or I'll drown

That bird wan ring, Mugz don't take the rope and hang
Yourself, too smart, safe guard your heart
Safe guard your heart
[Verse 2: Mugz]
I walked through fire and got burned, what did I learn
That every adult sins and it was just my turn
Ima firm believer in hit your head to keep it up
Cause you was looking down instead of looking up
Hard to see where you going with your eyes closed
You just walking, not realizing it's down the wrong road
Admit I was controlled by hormones and not thinking
Sink or swim my favorite analogy it's no fun when you sinking
Stinking, reaking of bad decisions and weed
My choices brought stress from problems I didn't need
What if I got a seed, it weighs heavy on my mental
A youngin raise a youngin but still I teach him or her the fundamental
Sentimental moment I'm losing myself being being myself
Every bad choice leads to a disintegration of my health
As if I don't got enough underneath my belt
As if the heat I'm taking ain't gon eventually make me melt

If only I could fly, but no not I
I sing caged bird blues , drink booze, watch life pass me by
I got money but can't afford happiness what could I buy
Maybe a slice of pie or a piece of mind
Who am I, if I can't touch the Sky, a penguin
I taught I saw a putty cat inside brave men
Hoped ya peeped the quotes, they free but in the same boat
They look at me i look them like yeah we both
Lost in the frost of this glacier called earth
Made from dust and dirt but that ain't our worth
If this bird don't sing no bells won't ring
I can't make no hits if I don't at least swing
Its gon rain it's gon rain let it fall like tears
I shed all my fear, through the fog I saw clear
Lend me your ear, let me drop some jewels
You down because you stayed there after you fell
Oh well, I tried to tell ya a smile don't mean shit
They luv the hits but could give a fuck about this
Hurt in my heart , that made this great art
GET GOD ON THE PHONE shit is too hard
Emotionally physically and mentally scarred
Who are you to try to pull my card
Dig up old bones in my backyard
But there's none there I'm way too clean
I put it all on these beats the SHIT I did and seen

The noose of life struggles will choke you
The hatred and envy of enemies will provoke you
But baby, remember what I told you
We gon be alright
When things go left, god will show you right

In dark he will be your light, in pitch black he will shine bright
We gon be alright",rap,That Bird,0.6,0.4,2016

I want crew's participation
In the strangulation of a nation
Concentrate and make fire stations die of smoke inhalation
A confrontation with more organization is complication
You better start looking for some new occupation
I slip the Reeboks on my feet and hit the street
You want beef, the top of your physique will hit the concrete
I rap like Iraq and bomb like Saddam
Rock a spot on your block that your clique's clocking on
A lot of little brains and names are flaming out the middle
So if wack attracts fire you're a heat seeking missile
A pillow cushion on your face and now your souls in control
Ate your soul, watch me put holes in your South Pole
I fill up coffins every so often
I wanna go to Heaven but Hell's closer and I hate walking
So M double I.L.K. will represent
The hip hop is hotter than sex inside a leather tent

I'll take the hot pliers out the fire
Stick 'em and pull out the wack wire
See the perception I be stressing is protection
I'm so bad I make girls vaginal section get erection
With perfection, you wanna race me than chase me
Your punk ass crews couldn't face me if ya maced me
So back up and let me move, I got a bloody point to prove
On a violent vibe and ready to groove

Is that your only diss, calling me a clone?
That’s the best you can do? Grow a backbone!
That’s a low blow and it’s not a real diss
Soon you’ll be tossed down the abyss!

I had to make a choice
To get it or accept
So much poison in the air
I ain't wanna take a breath
And at times I would be scared
But I never chose death
In a game with no ref
I played the cards I was dealt
I had to play the field
Get it how I live
I could never keep a friend

Had to use my common sense

This right here’s for all my niggas!
This right here’s for---
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I get closer everyday to the brink
My soul ain't sitting right, my heart ain't beating well or in sync
I get lost inside my thoughts when I think, all my wisdom extinct
Just an artist when I'm rapping, when if we link
A nigga boy to this systеm that wants me dead or gone missing
And got mе fed up existing. I'll throw my life in the ring
Just to feel something. Anything to feel something
Now even stating what I like brings me anger, fear, and spite
I ain't lost, just a soldier with his helmet and his knife
Lost the rifle and his sight, I ain't pressed, just ight
At my best when I'm mourning or I'm stressing through the night
Haven't known happiness since I was pushed forced to see the light
I know I'm passionate but that won't be enough to prove I'm right
Am I wrong if I'm questioning the methods of our fight
How much is my freedom worth if freedom's free for whites
The men I thought were leaders showed their colors blue and pink
Corrupted by the substance, capitol their ghoulish kink
Tossed the goal aside and tore us down for Cuban links
'Cause niggas gon be broke until the systems' broken
They showed me why I stand with women when it's fists we're holding
Ain't satisfied till it's survivors that we give devotion
I hope you notice I've been focused on my actions mostly
And stepping back, lending space for those not in this for the boasting
I hear stomping in the street, will I rise or ride the beat
If my eyes are watching God I'd find some solace on my feet
No more silence not from me, I let my conscience loose to speak
All these actions and words as intentional as can be
[Verse 2]
Yo
We want revision, some niggas don't see the vision
Not begging for you to listen but hold up, shift your pistons
They're gearing up for a war and we're peering off to the distance
Fighting for revolution, you marching for recognition!
What is it, that you wanted? Decisions, fall upon us
To make, so we can break and be victims like how they want us
Predictable as a sonnet, you'd kill us for half their privilege
Dawg, black men we living so disingenuous
Pillaging our own villages for everything that's provided
By all our family united until we're entering
And say all black lives matter until it's Megan
And Courtney, Brayla, or Kayla we aiming our hatred aimless
I hate it! Tell me why we can't just say her name
Nigga

[Verse 3]
I hear them in the crowd, shouting out ""let them speak""
Before the bullets fly, I'm arriving at my peace
And it's there for a second. Gone in a blink
So I don't need a ride I'll drive myself to the brink
Dearly departed. Dearly departed
I hope you're happy now
Look what you started
[Refrain]
I don't know what's out there
But it's slow for down here
Won't need a ride where I'm going

Won't need a ride where I'm going

I'm sick because I'm white and my bars have a lot of meaning
That's because my barz come from the streets and now from what I'm dreaming...
Alls you hear about these days is, 'imma hit this shit so hard'
Tbh you should be talking about how drugs are bad so show them the red card...
Also in every rap I ever here they always use the word nigga at least 3 times
Even when teens are spitting barz in the lunch line its all grime...
But grime isn't good it just sounds meaningless and too rough
It doesn't make you sound good and to be honest its not tough...
Your making rap look like its gone downhill since pac died
And if he was still alive if he could hear your rap he would of commited suicide...
See when I rap I talk about my life and how I changed from a young age
And not how 'I waz gonna go get high and pissed coz its ma birthday'...

...see you back my dawg
I just pray they take the shackles off
Need my people from behind the wall
I don't even wanna answer call

This some heartfelt shit, catch a hot slug
We ain't finna drive around, we gon' park up
Lay a pussy nigga down if he skeng 'nough
Brodie did time for some gang stuff
Now he locked down walking with a shank up
'Cause the Glock pound got him into handcuffs
He was riding wasn't thinking 'bout no cameras
Now he thinking 'bout his life, got to man up
He want a wife now, tell him pipedown
You know the street life, this shit is quite wild
It gets crazy, baby nina, fuck a baby
Niggas know I got something to lose, so they page me
Hit 'em no bruise, my nigga this .380
Wavy like du's, my nigga I call it Bailey's
You got something to lose, my guy we got to make cheese
Talk about jewels, my nigga you want an A.P
How you on the news, my nigga you moving hasty
I know niggas sweet, you want to eat 'em like pastry's
Let's do it smooth, go take him to the bakery
Set the timer, warm him up and shoot him up blatantly
I can't go back to the snow
No boots on my feet, wit' my sneaks full of holes
Mama did her best, but she did it on her own
When I had nothing left, still got it like I'm grown

You got something to lose don't let 'em take it
Every time they drive you to court, that's a slave ship
You can go adapt to the life, but don't embrace it
You can do better my nigga, let's hit the A-list
But you the muscle, you just like to crush kids
The way you straighten 'em out, you like braces
Couple niggas doing life, growing ancient
I just wanna better the gang, let's get a spaceship
Roney still clean the block up, call me maintenance
Roney still hit an opp up, 'till he aching
Roney still doing gang shit, not faking
Roney send a hitta *bam, bam, bam!* he Jamaican
Get my youngin drop a package off
Shorty got a ratchet, and it match her bra
Fuck her, but it's only if it's cash involved
'Cause my dawg behind the wall playing basketball
Free the dawgs and the opps 'till they all fall
Streets give 'em justice, we don't need the law
Pull it, and I bust it he can eat a shot
Roney like the sun, he can heat the block
We don't need to stop
We just need a wop
Wrap it up and press it, use machines a lot
Need my dawg from behind the wall
He locked up playing basketball

And is rented by a liberal proponent of capitalism
Who believes that the God's gift to Black and Brown people
Then appropriate the culture, of which they are a vulture
Caught the rollers on the lady with her baby in the stroller
Who was raised where they just moved to from in the zone
It's the old neighborhood with the whiter population
Under the codenames, ""Up and coming, revitalization""

When the transplant treats the native family with discernment
I lived it, you learned it, you bought it, I earned it

While these medical marijuana and artesian beer drafters
Get the benefit of the doubt, but if they are young or Black
Are with the thought of legal weed and hipster rap attract laughter
Sometimes, I feel like I'm hatin' for no reason at all
But when I hit the block, there's barely no Black people at all
Or no Latinos at all, or Filipinos at all
Just art collectors and loft, do they respect us or naw?

I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""

What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

Being a part of a Charade
Losing in the end like a game of Spades
Traveling up and down an escalade
Forbade and then locked in a cage
One thing that we will never do is Fade

It gets harder and harder to make a wage
The situation that surround us are getting lame
Life doesn't last any longer by having Fame
In another chapter which turns another page
Getting played and sent on a wild goose chase
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Will there be a day in the shade?
Is there a way when we got to find a way to make pay?
Would work still be waiting for you when you awake?
To come back to the home that is laid to find that the floors had been paved
No matter what is placed on the plate
One thing that we will never do is Fade
Could it be right because we all make mistakes?
It is difficult to keep it real with the fake
Maybe laws should be tried again at a later date
With plenty of space to move away but have to stay
Where one can be in the same place but in a different State
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Handed a short end of the stick to slice the cake
Not a hand to aide in the crack between the quake
False representing evil ways by appearing saved
Out of all of the money made there is a breach in the safe
It doesn't matter what someone has at stake
One thing that we will never do is Fade

Telling everyone that it is what it is when it ain't
Having to be talked to while they rave a rant all Day
A Priest may be able to do it because I can't

Psssss hey you look listen I gotta real talk true story I gots to tell about
A very sad situation that's unfortunately how life happens in reality your gonna know oh so very very well

Verse 1:
Yo what up with all these buster lame deer
Who just can’t hang or bang
Let alone be a brother from another mother playing it cool with poise like
True R&P emcee trailblazers that’s down by law to honorable
Hip hop
Causes prepared for whatever life throws at him
Generating interest
Not being boring likе some lame-o’s cause I’m spitting rhymеs for the unlucky kids
Without a dad or mom that got cheated in life blessing them reciting this psalm prayer
Hopefully to be answered as providence eventually so sucker lame deer playing adulting games
See the error in there ways that could never afford
To help
One another or be honest let alone fathom to understand why is that imagining
What it’s like to be younger again getting shafted caught in a dead end job
Life happens being stuck in the rat races maze thats why sinderella manns
Staying truest in this krush groove funkyfresh
Never stale
Just new photosynthesized oxygen every little step
I take by myself
On this lone road not you Bobby brown to move people untraceably with power musics
Meaning that lame deer benignly neglect sinderella mann
For filthy rat emcees
Polluted corny cliched hogwash crap copycunts can duplicate but fail to bite or replicate
This multi spectrual flow let alone figure out what
Makes sinderella mann tick
Trying to mock his highnesses hotshot heroine overdose mind boggling
Keep it gangster with ya flair your trying to diss but don’t even know the half
Like any mitch bade trick without rhymes to recite yourself
Jelly sickling saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young
Again
OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance
To seize everything wanted getting the best
Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 2:
Whose living the coolest baller tipping for life thats got it made in the shade
Is what matters most fuck your opinion outside that conclusion
Without
Bullshit popularity contests dammit from east coast to west coast
Keep the crossover
Sinderella manns gonna stay frosty like a snowman using this funk while
Many act as if they enjoy being conventionally boring in some square trendy
Predictable life cycling manner sinderella mann
Won’t ever understand
Others lame deer games who shall remain nameless
Because your soo vain
You couldn’t keep the mic hot and you probably think this song is about you dont you dont you
Lacking Rockwell’s voice and rick James’s guitar skills
Cause you never had
The option or choice sinderella mann does barking preternatural powers in the dark
Rocking rhymes ripping the mic all indolent imbeciles can't relate to
With disgust in your eyes
Being another brick in the wall pussyfooter that doesn’t have shit on true loc’ed out
Hip hop gangsters like sinderella mann dropping refillable scripts to blow
Your fucking brains out with funky grammar as a certified jammer living to win
Down to expose any flaker for the fraud you are through
This melody
Thats strong enough to visualize celestial astrology
Coming to life
Thats very real unless your left behind saying
Hook:
OPS there goes your one and only shot in life
OPS humans forget what it’s like to be young

OPS not making your stance fighting for that one opportunities
Chance

Outta life
Paying the prices cost you wanna live to give what you get ops the song of life goes on
Ops ops ops ops

Verse 3:
You only get one chance everyday until you die to become
What you wanna be
From being wide awake and alive living it up having the time of your life
Enjoying yourself until it’s all over so make experiencing existence
A sight to be seen
For what it’s truly worth ceasing every valid opportunity to succeed
In life
Why be normal living a generic predictable basic lifetime
When you can give back
Working hard cause you played your fucking self now stop sleeping stay woken in life
While adulting without catching ops this is a odyssey even
When some lose the will to change
Guess that’s nothing new or strange like being broke as a joke having no spare cents
To make dollars as these dreams in mind with passion
From the heart aren’t free
You need fuel for the journey as life flows on long after the thrill of living is gone
Monotone humans get older and grayer in the face
Not many age
Gracefully doing the same old song and dance routine
Never spicing it up
Adding variety which’s the true wealth in life having plenty of options set aside
It’s a damn shame word is bond everyone can’t grow up while still being a child at heart
Working having fun that doesn’t drain the life outta you let alone discuss music
Or play catch up cause many are preoccupied adulting so I guess what they say is true
Life happens now your halting questioning endless
Confusions
Continual crisis of shortcoming mishaps and faults not able to leave all the worrying behind
To ignore it all smelling the roses enjoying life’s simple things cause your stuck saying
Hook 2:
OPS OPS OPS OPS there goes your one and only chance
Stuck in a suckers lifestyle
Were others are so bogus and normal that they choose willful ignorance in a slave mentality
To treat you like your the exact same as them numb to others
Predicaments
Only seeing there own circumstances everyones normal until you get to know them forneverlanders
So until then just recall with all people and many

As an old man I still will spark chronic
Got the dope shit, you could call the skill narcotic
Still our dollar bills won't fill our wallets

Chiddy: Damn, yo I just woke up son. That was the craziest dream ever dawg. Black Thought came through and gave us some advice and got on the track. Some Hollywood shit

[Verse 1]
They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn’t come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles, but now I’m Socrates
With philosophies
I’m in my tree house please don’t bother me
And now it’s lookin’ like hella smoke
Under age they lettin’ me pass the velvet rope
And this life getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star, Texas
[Hook]
Uh huh I know what’s on your mind
You don’t think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was weak I tell you I am getting strong
This time its gonna be different than the last time
I swear I’m gonna turn this from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

[Verse 2]
Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon
Hatin’ on even on the roof I’m upper echelon
But still forever we shine
Turn a negative to positive I never decline

Before it all falls down
I guess I’ll throw it all away

[Spoken Word Bridge]
Eliza's entire life was packed into a bag that night. Everything unimportant left behind. She'd departed for a place perched high above a glacial plane: The Athеns Asylum for the Clinically Insane. It looked likе some sort of castle or prison from your dreams. The type that wakes you up in the middle of the night with sweat and screams. Eliza's heart sank. She panicked and cried. She begged not to be locked away on the other side. But before she knew it, so suddenly, so quick, the nurse shut the door and it sealed with a click
She sobbed for three years 'til her tear well ran dry. And then she conjured up a plan to make an escape for it that night. So she slipped out the window, past the spring, lover's lane. She was almost home free 'til a search light hit her face

And I ain't got nuttin' in my refrigerator

Tighter than most skin
And closer than cousins

Things are different now though
Because I would follow (So I let her move in)

So I have her a chance (To get back on her feet)
Given the circumstances

I don't understand this
How could she play me

Breaking up my mood
While eating up all my food

And then she dirties the kitchen

But I ain't goin roll
Trying to pay for us both
Instead of giving me more stress
Handle your mess
Or we'll both be homeless

Have you ever felt left out of the group, excluded?
Given the boot when you knew you should have been a shoe-in, like
Some ancient Druid was pursuant to ruin your life
With a curse but worse, he brought his whole damn crew in

And now it’s high noon and you’re a target to shoot at
This school’s a battlefield, no wonder you’re truant
They always look at you and they boo at what you’re doing
And you go off like a bomb at the Olympics in Munich

Nah, you’re just an extraterrestrial
Less than respectable
You’ll never get to get the girl

You’re just a jester at the festival
I guess it’s acceptable
To peg your head with vegetables
And kick you in the testicles
And best of all let you know that you’re a filthy dog
And you’ll never be best in show
So why the abuse?
‘Cause all a bully needs is another excuse
[Chorus: Benatar]

Planet Earth, I need a friend
‘Cause I’m on the outside looking in
I’m an Alien
I’m just an Alien

Feeling lost but never found
‘Til I found myself being pushed around
I’m an alien
Yes, I’m an alien

[Verse 2: Puff Puff Humbert]

I’ma be honest, it gets better, I promise
So don’t let them ground you down to a pound of sawdust
Stay on the stage the longest ’til the gong hits and everybody comments
On their fondness of your polish and your overall knowledge

Remain calmest and abolish your modesty
‘Cause honestly you got to be positive, you’re a prodigy
You show the world that you’re not to mess with
It’s a broken home that makes these bastards aggressive

You can expect to get rejected
Neglected, stripped naked, and tested until they reckon
You feel terrible because nothing is comparable
Violence ain’t the answer but the pain is unbearable
You’re nice and jaded from being isolated
Now you coast through life feeling twice as hated
So why the abuse?
‘Cause all a bully needs is another excuse

Loneliness was all she knew
Because of her God sent beauty
Evil and carnage were sure to ensure
Her death was Conchobars duty
The high king Conchobar would not dare
So he did her away from his people
Deirdre will live and grow up fair
Then marry me in my temple

(18 yrs. Later)
She was disgusted by Conchobar
And vowed she would not be wed
I love only the man who bears the colours-
Black white and blood red
I know such man!,her aide explained
But Deirdre could only hope
Uisneach's sons were led to the forest
With Naoise, she would elope
No place was safe for the four exiles
They left Eireann with heavy hearts
But to see her face and see her smile
Gave the brothers strength to depart
In Albas' hills they made their home
And began a simple life
Local hatred had suddenly grown
Men wanted her as a wife

Conchobar dreamed of Deirdre his true love
He longed for the touch of her skin
His duties neglected, his life so affected
Why did she leave the court of the King?
After some time he explained he was wrong
Or so we were led to believe
This sorrowful song I have sung for too long
Naoise agus Deirdre I now forgive

Naoise always longed to go back home
When he heard the news he wept
The brothers prepared for the journey ahead
With Fergus Mac Roth they all left
The exiles returned to the King alone
And knew there was something not right
Conchobar made his plans be known
The brothers took up the fight
The exiles fled to the sorrowful forest
Foloowed by the king's men
Deirdre was hidden but they needed rest
They could not fight again
Naoise smelt death and he quietly said-
Please Deirdre stay where you are
A belt of a sword and the brothers fell dead
Deirdre smelt blood on the air

(Conchobar:)
Cannot you see, I did this for you
Our wedding can now take place
They left for Fern Mag, as the cold wind blew
In a chariot she felt deaths embrace

Is I'm a Skynyrd fan

Like the elephant in the corner of the south

Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me

The sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away.""
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""
Mmm Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day.""

987,989,Tebey,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

988,990,Howe Gelb,"Well, the piano’s stealing Lou Reed licks
Licks that he probably stole
I wish they were Duke Ellington’s
Like a wish we never could [hold]

The tongue is talking like Lou now
Like it had no choice or nothing else to do now
I wish it would wag like Kerouac
I wish we’d never feel blue now

Well, a friend who died for three minutes said
“There really is a light at the end of the tunnel when you’re dead
But it’s a tunnel you can’t run toward
Because the tunnel is [smart], [then] the size of [ ] head”

993,995,Kris Kristofferson & Brenda Lee,"Her long legs looked like trouble
As she sasheyed through the door
And my mind flashed a warning sign
That I chose to ignore
For the prize I thought I could win
The risk seemed mighty small
The bigger the fool the harder the fall

Fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
Under all that beauty
Beat a heart that was made of ice
God knows as far as I could see she didn't have a flaw
But the bigger the fool the harder the fall

I said a woman to keep
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end
Well, one lesson I've learned that applies to all
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
One day she was lovin' me
The next day she was gone
And I became another verse
To a lonesome heartbreak song
Now that I've learned to face the truth
The words stick in my craw
Well, the bigger the fool the harder the fall

I said a woman to keep
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end

Yellow dog bus, blacktop highway
Those butterflies fly on game day
All the shops close up as the sun goes down
Here come those Friday night lights in a touchdown town

[Chorus]
And it's the roar of the crowd (The roar of the crowd)
When they're screaming your name out loud (Your name out loud)
Every time you hear your fight song
Singing ""We won't back down""
Here come those Friday night lights in a touchdown town

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you step on that field, feel the chill in the air
Take pride in those colors that you wear
All the boys got your back, you got your girl in the stands
You hear ""Thunderstruck"" and the clash of the band

[Chorus]
And it's the roar of the crowd (The roar of the crowd)
When they're screaming your name out loud (Your name out loud)
Every time you hear your fight song
Singing ""We won't back down""
Here come those Friday night lights in a touchdown town
[Bridge]
Letter jackets in the closet, yearbooks collecting dust
Those old trophies in the attic start to tarnish and rust
Yeah, it was fourth down and goal, we were going for the win
And when I step on that stage, I feel that feeling again

And it's the roar of the crowd (The roar of the crowd)
When they're screaming your name out loud (Your name out loud)
